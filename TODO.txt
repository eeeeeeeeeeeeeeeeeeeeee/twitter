Easy tasks:

[+] Correlate volume of tweets with age, party affiliation, gender,

house/senate status (multiple regression)

[+] Correlate number of followers with age, party affiliation, gender,

house/senate status

Study the congresspeople who don't have Twitter accounts - what states do

they come from?



Less trivial tasks:

[+] Correlate volume of tweets with state data (fraction of voters who are

youth, for instance)

[+] Correlate number of followers per capita with state data



Harder tasks:

Correlate volume of tweets with percent of people who voted for them [hard]

Correlate number of followers per capita with percent of people who voted

for them [hard, since congressional races are staggered]

Examine the social graph of congresspeople.  Which congresspeople are

followed by the most congresspeople?  The least? [hard, due to rate limits]

Do congresspeople disproportionately follow people from their own party?

Correlate sentiment of tweets with percent of people who voted for them



Action items:



3. Write MySQL query to correlate Twitter data with state data.





4. Do the following regressions:



- Age vs. tweets, followers, following, followers/following per capita



- Age, party, gender, house/senate status vs. tweets, followers, etc.



- Percent black, Asian, etc. vs. tweets, followers, etc.



- Percent 18 to 24 vs tweets, followers, etc.



- 18-24, 25-34, etc. vs tweets, followers, etc.







Perform t-tests for



- Party vs. tweets, followers, following, etc.



- Gender vs. tweets, followers, etc.



- House/senate status vs. tweets, followers, etc.
