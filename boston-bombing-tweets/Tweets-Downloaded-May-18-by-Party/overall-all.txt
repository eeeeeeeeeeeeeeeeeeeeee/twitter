The time is ripe for monetary reform. Getting monetary policy right is the foundation for economic growth. @CatoEvents
Stable prices and a sound dollar are what create the best foundation for job growth over the long term. @CatoEvents

It?s time for a thorough review of U.S. monetary policy via the Centennial Monetary Commission Act http://t.co/V8D8iMOYFi @CateEvents
Creation of asset price bubbles, excess reserves on balance sheet are fuel for future inflation and incentive for financial repression.
Whatever its short-term benefits may be, quantitative easing poses great risks over time.  Let me outline three:  @CatoEvents
What are the benefits of quantitative easing?  Fed officials argue that QE is responsible for rising asset prices. @CatoEvents
While QE1 helped to boost stock prices, its effects on the real economy were quite small. @CatoEvents
Since 2008, monetary policy has gone into discretionary and interventionist hyper-drive... @CatoEvents
Monetary policy can only have a direct, positive effect on employment in short, temp spurts, at the cost of future econ growth &amp; employm
In response to ?stagflation,? Congress gave the Fed a dual mandate assigning equal weight to achieving stable prices and full employment.
During the 80s &amp; 90s, Chairmen Volcker &amp; Greenspan conducted monetary policy as if the Fed had a single mandate for price stability.
Fed failed its role as lender of last resort between 1929 &amp; 1933, leading to unnecessary bank failures, intensifying the Great Depressio
While the early Fed was successful in providing an elastic currency, eliminating the frequent, seasonal financial panics of the 19th century
Get monetary policy right, and our economy will have the wind at its back. @CatoEvents #GrowthGap
Get monetary policy wrong, our economy will face headwinds that good fiscal and regulatory policies may not be able to overcome @CatoEvents
We need to return to a predictable, rules-based monetary policy that maintains the purchasing power of the US dollar over time. @CatoEvents
We must overhaul the federal regulatory process to ensure necessary regulations are balanced and cost-effective @CatoEvents #GrowthGap
We must reduce federal spending &amp; debt as a percent of GDP, and we must pursue pro-growth tax reform. @CatoEvents #GrowthGap
If we want the United States to remain the world?s economic superpower, we must close this #GrowthGap. @CatoEvents
1% #GrowthGap is the difference between an $80T economy &amp; a $50T economy in 2062 &amp; is $97T less in federal taxes over 50 years. @Cat
A one-percentage point difference may not sound like much, but it is huge. Over the next 50 years... @CatoEvents #GrowthGap
The CBO recently reduced its estimate for future growth in potential real GDP from 3.2 percent to 2.2 percent. @CatoEvents #GrowthGap
Even more troubling is the possibility that the ability of economy to grow has been *permanently* diminished. @CatoEvents #GrowthGap
This recovery has produced $1.2T less in real GDP &amp; 4.1M fewer private sector jobs than an avg recovery during last 7 decades. @CatoEven
The Growth Gap is the difference in economic performance between this recovery and an average post-World War II recovery. @CatoEvents
Let me frame monetary policy in the broader context of the most critical economic challenge that we face?the Growth Gap. @CatoEvents
The work that @CatoInstitute does in pursuit of economic freedom and limited government is more important than ever. @CatoEvents
News stories breaking about the IRS targeting political enemies &amp; the DoJ wire-tapping the AP show something is clearly wrong. @CatoEven
Big government is a breeding ground for political abuse &amp; harmful social experimentation. Americans should not be Washington?s lab rabbi
Obama's policies are troubling; revelations over the past 5 days are awakening many to the dangers of unrestrained government. @CatoEvents

Taxes aren?t the forms you fill out. Americans pay taxes daily. Use your phone or filling your car? You?re paying taxes. It adds up. #TaxDay
Taxpayers had to wade through over 100 pages of instructions. In 1935, just two pages. This is too much red tape. #TaxDay
April 17 is #TaxFreedomDay. In 1900, this day was on January 22. This is too much! Americans cannot continue to shoulder such a burden.
It's #Tax Day. It drives home Washington's out of control spending and need to pass a Balanced Budget Amendment. #BBA http://t.co/6OsobufH

ICYMI: Why I voted NO on the Senate-passed fiscal cliff bill --&gt; http://t.co/nKX9gtQm
Massive tax increases, massive spending increases, massive increases in our national debt. Here's why I'm voting NO: http://t.co/ScfPh1ma
Happy to see the House pass HR 6726, a Congressional pay freeze that I cosponsored, by a 287-129 vote margin.
On days like today we remember how blessed we truly are. From my family to yours, Merry Christmas.

WATCH LIVE- The Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee hearing with ICE on why criminal aliens released http://t.co/fZMGrGECKO
Sequester was a polticial issue in Feb. all while immigration reform being worked on. This was like throwing a hand grenade in all of that.
Rep. Dent also just said this should have been handled better and was disappointed in how the releases were dealt with. Agreed Rep. Dent.
I agree with Rep. Dent and am worried these releases were an attempt to undermine the comprehensive immigration reform.
ICE Dir. Morton testifies at Homeland Security Approp. Subcommitte hearing 2,228 criminal aliens were released of a 3-week period in Feb.
ICE Dir. Morton just testified no level 1 illegal aliens were released in Texas; level one offenses such as agg. robbery, agg. sexual asslt.
ICE Director John Morton is testifying before the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee right now; answering Chairman Carter's Q's.
HR 890 passed the House today. It will prohibit The White House from waiving important work requirements for welfare recipients.

Obama says the talking points on #Benghazi are a sideshow. For the families who lost loved ones, this isn't a sideshow.
On #Benghazi, Pres says "We must hold accountable those who perpetrated this event. We had a review board who investigated every aspect."
President on #IRS repercussions: "They have to be held fully accountable because their agency is independent and must have full integrity."

My thoughts on the Mayor Bloomberg ad currently running on television in Arizona.
Acting IRS Commissioner resigns. Hopefully just the first step in what needs to be a long, thorough process of restoring confidence.
Just heard Mayor Bloomberg is running more ads against me. If the mayor of NYC doesn't like my votes, I guess I?m on the right track.
Hmmm. Maybe @michaelcrow shouldn't have laughed at the Obama reference to an IRS audit http://t.co/TLcBw82qMJ
Intro?d bill today to combat dangerous IRS practice of targeting tax-exempt orgs based on ideology: http://t.co/btHBjqzXSh
Wow. First the IRS targets conservative groups. Now the DoJ targets the AP. What's next? HUD targeting homeowners?
POTUS has strong words for IRS on its targeting of conservative groups. Fine, but now let's see some follow through.  What's next?
So, if "low level" staffers at the IRS can target #teaparty and #patriot, what's next? Party registration? Donation history?
Border security amendments from Sens Grassley and Cornyn adopted in markup will improve #immigrationreform bill.
Just had another amendment adopted.  This one would require that GAO provide an annual review of the DHS border strategy.
My amendment to add private landowner owners to border commission was just adopted in committee markup.

Sec. Clinton regarding contradictory Benghazi explanations: "What difference does it make?" We'll, quite a difference, actually.

Evangelicals are playing a large and important role in pushing immigration reform forward.
We will deal with illegal immigrants in the country today in a 'Firm but Fair' manner.
On immigration, we are taking South Carolina's lead and making E-Verify mandatory across the nation. Its a big step in the right direction.
We have to get to the bottom of what happened in the IRS scandal. Seems to be a culture of political manipulation in play.
The Obama Administration has been trying to pull the wool over the American peoples eyes about what happened in #Benghazi.
Former Secretary Clinton should return and testify again before the Congress about #Benghazi.

If Boston is not an example of a pre-9/11 stovepiping mentality what would be?
If Benghazi is not an example of system failure before, during, and after the attack what would be?
For over seven and a half hours during the Benghazi attack our Americans in the field were abandoned.
....numerous warnings from Ambassador Stevens about the growing threats from al Qaeda were ignored by Washington.
In Benghazi, multiple requests for increased security were denied and numerous warnings from Ambassador Stevens....
With all due respect Mr. President, #Benghazi and #Boston are compelling examples of how our national security systems have deteriorated.

Now speaking with Fox News about Boston suspect and enemy combatant status.
About to speak on-air with Fox News about Boston bombing.
A decision to NOT read Miranda rights to the suspect was sound and in our national security interests.
Under the Law of War, suspect must be humanely treated, consistent w/ the Detainee Treatment Act, domestic law, and the Geneva Conventions.
As to any future trial, if this suspect is an American citizen, he is NOT subject to military commission trial. #Boston
An enemy combatant is entitled to a habeas hearing before a federal judge with appointment of a counsel. Usually, w/in 30 days of capture.
In a case like #Boston, it could take weeks to prepare the questions needed to be asked &amp; months before intelligence gathering is comple
The questioning of an enemy combatant for national security purposes has no limit on time or scope.
American citizens who take up arms against our nation or collaborate with our enemies HAVE been held as enemy combatants.
Just released this statement with @KellyAyotte @SenJohnMcCain and @RepPeteKing about Boston / enemy combatant.. https://t.co/0i4Utv7EO9
Under the Law of War we can hold #Boston suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel.
...criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim, and kill innocent Americans.#Boston
The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise....
It is clear events we have seen over the past few days in Boston were an attempt to kill American citizens &amp; terrorize a major American 
Just put out this statement with @SenJohnMcCain about #Boston suspect and #Miranda warning.  http://t.co/FZ4FKUb37w
I hope the Obama Administration will seriously consider this option. #Boston
The goal is to gather intelligence and protect our nation which is under threat from radical Islam. #Boston
The Law of War allows us to hold individual in this scenario as potential enemy combatant w/o Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel.
The least of my worries is a criminal trial which will likely be held years from now. #Boston
We should be focused on preventing possible attacks over the coming hours and days.  #Boston
It is vital he be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes about possible future plots. #Boston
Now that the suspect is in custody, the last thing I want is for him to remain silent. #Boston
I appreciate the hard work and bravery  of our law enforcement and intelligence communities. #Boston
@washpost Boston bombing is 'Exhibit 'A' of why the homeland is the battlefield http://t.co/ed7t0jjzOu
The Obama Administration needs to be contemplating these issues and should not rush into a bad decision.
The last thing we may want to do is read Boston suspect Miranda Rights telling him to "remain silent."
If the #Boston suspect has ties to overseas terror organizations he could be treasure trove of  information.
If captured, I hope Administration will at least consider holding the Boston suspect as enemy combatant for intelligence gathering purposes.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and first responders in Boston.
In 2010, over 13,000 fugitives failed a background check yet less than 15 people were successfully prosecuted.
We already have major holes in the current NICS system. Instead of expanding a broken background check system, let?s fix it.
I will oppose the Toomey-Manchin background check amendment. The proposal, while well-intentioned, is not a solution to illegal gun violence
I welcome a debate on gun control. The American people deserve to see where their elected representatives stand on the Second Amendment.
The gun control legislation can still be filibustered after today in the United States Senate.
My legislation, backed by the NRA, would make a real difference in keeping guns out of the wrong hands.
I have my own legislation, supported by the NRA, which I want to bring forward in the Senate.

Hatch: "Number Five ? We need to strengthen Medicaid for patients and states through realistic reforms."
Hatch: "Number Four ? We need to increase quality and lower costs in Medicare by introducing competitive bidding into the program."
Hatch: "Number Three ? We need to simplify Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing while protecting seniors from catastrophic health costs."
Hatch: "Number Two?Modernize Medigap by limiting supplemental Medicare plans from covering initial out-of-pocket expenses for beneficiaries"
Hatch: "Number One - We need to adjust the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67."

Hatch: "In the next ten years, federal Medicaid spending as a share of the U.S. economy is set to grow by 37 percent."
Hatch: "Fixing Medicare won?t just be a matter of trimming off some of the fat and waste ? the problems with the program are systemic."

Sen
Hatch: Most Republicans open to increased revenues, but only if revenue increases are coupled with entitlement spending reform.
President?s insistence on $1.6 tril tax hike that isn't supported by the American ppl nor even elected Dems isn?t about deficit reduction.
With a deficit of over $1 trillion, the President is willing to send us over the cliff for as little as $23 billion in additional revenue.
Republicans have expressed willingness to work w/ the President to raise revenue without raising tax rates, but the Pres refuses to budge.
Why would Democrats jeopardize the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of American workers and the economic security of their families?
But it seems increasingly clear that the President and Democrats in Congress are content to go over the cliff, regardless of the outcome.
Need to have a serious convo about spending, but so far the President, @TheDemocrats &amp; liberal interest groups have refused to engage.
President?s commitment to balanced approach of new tax revenue &amp; spending reforms has morphed into new tax revenue and increased spendin

@TheBigChezy Well, I'll give you big points for staying on message. Not so much for policy analysis or real fiscal responsibility.

@FreedomsSon Inflation!! Right. Haven't seen much of it in last 5 years. So do you give Obama credit for keeping that "tax" low?
@libertytreeman And is it your belief that calling people names strengthens or weakens the power of your argument? Just curious.
@libertytreeman Everybody who is owed money by the gov gets paid. That's why we call it "full faith and credit".
@libertytreeman No I don't. I never said that. I say we pay ALL our bills. As we always have.
@FreedomsSon and by you guys, you mean Reagan, Bush and Bush, right? Cause that's when debt really grew as a % of our economy.
@FreedomsSon Taxes are as low as a % of our economy as they've been since the late 50s.
Merely bringing #paychinafirst to the floor will create questions in financial markets about our willingness to stand by our commitments.
We should argue about what bills we incur and how much we tax. That's our job. But as Washington and Hamilton knew we should PAY OUR BILLS.

@alexisgoldstein According to twitter he lives in DC, so not likely a constituent. And yes, when people don't research I will raise that.
@alexisgoldstein Plausible is a pretty thin thread on which to hang a charge of absence of integrity.
@alexisgoldstein I'm fascinated with the pride of those who believe that those who disagree are either stupid, inattentive or corrupt.
@alexisgoldstein And re "captured by banks" is it possible we've thought this through and have a different opinion than you do?
@alexisgoldstein @repdavidscott Moreover 992 does not exempt asset backed or structured swaps from push out.
@alexisgoldstein @repdavidscott The AFR info is simply inaccurate. S 716 prohibits fed reserve support. FDIC is not taxpayer $, it's bank $.

@alexisgoldstein and asset backed. Sheila Bair and others thought 716 actually increased risk. But what does she know?
@jackthecat11 Fine, but mention that Barney Frank and many regulators also support this bill. Facts are confusing, no?
@alexisgoldstein Wrong. All dangerous derivatives still pushed out. Regulators and Barney Frank, among others, supported this bill.
@whytaneth it doesn't. This bill was supported by regulators, Barney Frank, many others.

@wriemer Ah, very good snark. Like the Goldman angle. Always a crowd pleaser. Only problem is I never called anyone a coward.
Had long talk w @ChuckSchumer on immigration reform. While not perfect, this is a GOOD bill for US. It starts moving in May. Advocate now!
@scottryanwill fair points, but I think there is a line between being critical of your opponents and being "self righteous".
@StevePosick @chrismurphyct It most certainly does not. Show me any data that proves causality. Post hoc ergo propter hoc is bad logic.
@adriamc And yes, you did. There is no ambiguity in "I was going to ask who paid for his vote".
@adriamc #cispa requires gov minimization of PII, forbids use 4 "national security" has civilian entry. Work to do, but it's a better bill
@adriamc @fatdaninc Ah, yes. The presumption that those we disagree with are corrupt. Our founders would be so proud.
@ScottBonz Not true. Nothing in #cispa forces employers to do anything, much less disclose passwords. This amendment was not germane to bill
@ScottBonz not at all. My amendment requires govt PII minimization, bill is much improved relative to last congress. Read it.
Joined @MayorBillFinch and many labor leaders in Bridgeport to mark the 26th anniversary of the L'Ambiance disaster which killed 28 workers.

It is wrong for #SCOTUS to silence democratic debate and redefine marriage by judicial fiat.
41 states affirm that marriage is between a man and a woman. Are we going to tell them their voices don?t count?
Redefining marriage would deny as a matter of policy the ideal that a child needs a mom and a dad. #DOMA
Decades of social science show that children do better when raised by a mom and dad. Obama agrees. #DOMA

CBC's budget protects and enhances Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, TANF &amp; other vital safety net programs for families
CBC's Budget doesnt endorse any specific recommendations of Simpson Bowles, but supports the goals of a $4 trillion, 10yr deficit reduction
The CBC Budget raises $1 trillion in new revenue to avoid sequestration, the self-inflicted economic disaster.
The CBC Budget proposes significant investments to accelerate our economic recovery and ensure that our recovery is felt in every community
The CBC Alternative Budget for 2014 puts forth a plan that reduces the deficit and alleviates harm inflicted by austerity measures
The CBC has a long history of submitting fiscally sound and socially responsible alternatives to budgets proposed by both Repubs &amp; Dem
Let?s have a budget that reflects our values
Democrats have a fair, balanced plan to cut spending responsibly, increase revenues, &amp; create growth with jobs.
The Republican fiscal plan claims to protect Medicare while ending it for future seniors.
To pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, it could raise taxes on middle class families by as much as $2,000 per year.
The Republican budget will result in 2 million fewer American jobs next year alone, decrease GDP 1.7 percent, &amp; stall our nation?s recov
Republican Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan builds on the failed proposals of the last two years by making them worse.
The Republican approach to the budget is putting millionaires and billionaires ahead of the middle class
The Repubs approach to the budget is the same as its approach to the sequester: protecting special interests rather than solving problems.
The Ryan Republican budget is ending the Medicare guarantee and shifting costs to seniors.
The Ryan Republican budget is undermining the health and economic security of the elderly and disabled.
The Ryan Republican budget is protecting the wealthiest at the expense of the middle class.
The Ryan Republican budget will Destroy jobs and put our economic recovery at risk.
The Ryan Republican budget is nothing more than more of the same plan that the American people rejected last fall.
Instead of targeting those in our  vulnerable communities, Republicans should work with Democrats towards  balanced and bipartisan solutions
Mr. Ryan finally appears willing to accept that revenues must be part of any solution to achieve real deficit reduction.
It again ends the Medicare guarantee, and shifts costs onto seniors.
The budget again includes trillions in undisclosed &amp; ambiguous spending cuts with little explanation of the policies required to affect

It was imperative that we supported the bipartisan, inclusive Senate version of VAWA instead of the partisan Republican proposal #VAWA
Honored to stand alongside President Obama as he signs into law Violence Against Women Act #VAWA
Section 5 of the #VotingRightsAct is constitutional. #VRA
Section 5 prohibits voting changes that have either the "purpose" or the "effect" of denying the right to vote on account of race. #VRA
Although the South?s culture has changed in the past 48 year the need for the #VotingRightsAct has not.
The #VotingRightsAct protects against "packing" black voters unnecessarily into safe districts.
Congress reaffirmed the validity of the #VotingRightsAct 6 yrs ago.The Supreme Court shouldnt take away this protection for minority voters.
The #VotingRightsAct is the "crown jewel" of the civil rights law.
The #VotingRightsAct was enacted to stop partisanship. This effort to strike it down is partisan misbehavior.
District lines can?t be gerrymandered in ways that weaken the electoral power of minorities. The #VotingRightsAct protects this.
The #VotingRightsAct was necessary in the 2012 general election to protect against discrimination like voter ID laws.
Voters still face disenfranchisement.E.g- a San Antonio district was redrawn in 2003 to keep 100k Latinos out and a Republican in #VRA

At Today's Gun Task Force hearing. We must stop gun violence NOW!!!! http://t.co/SD0X5wVv
In one year on average, almost 100,000 people in America are shot or killed with a gun.
I have again introduced the Child Gun Safety and Gun Access Prevention Act in the 113th Congress.
I am focused on making sure that we take steps to identify and treat people who have mental illness b4 they can harm themselves or others
What happened just over a month ago in Newtown was an unimaginable tragedy. What happens now is up to each of us here in Congress.
I commend the President for taking immediate and concrete steps today to reduce gun violence.
I look forward to working with Pres Obama and the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force to find sensible solutions to reduce gun violence
4 families of the victims of Sandy Hook, of every massacre and every incident of gun violence, there is simply no time to waste
Pres proposals reflect a series of clear and concrete steps in the effort to rein in, reduce, and prevent gun violence in our country.
Hearing on gun violence is complete. President?s gun proposals offer conrcrete steps. Congress should pass NOW!!!! http://t.co/Lrzpd5qM
It is now Congress?s responsibility to work with the President to move forward with this plan, which is based on common-sense ideas.
If even one child?s life can be saved, then we need to act. Now is the time to do the right thing for our children and communities
I just asked about the importance of storing guns in your home in a safe place. #PreventGunViolence
Each day 33 Americans are murdered by firearms. Congress needs to put lives of our constituents over politics #PreventGunViolence
I agree with @BarackObama that #NowIsTheTime to work together to prevent gun violence
While no law or set of laws will end gun violence, it is clear that the American people want action.
Documents: Read President Obama's gun law proposals and list of executive actions http://t.co/8FOLVv5y
We must also look at gun violence in other cities too such as Chicago a number of school age kids have been killed with gun.
The safety of America and its children should be at the forefront when it comes to making these gun safety laws.
This Congress must rise above partisan politics and now come together as the President has stated to pass these important gun safety laws.
@msnbc The president and our task force agree that we need a comprehensive approach to reduce and prevent gun violence.

It was a pleasure to meet with Mayors Scherer, Roach, and Jasmin rep'ing Mayors Against Illegal Guns http://t.co/js6dlZGw
Proud to have helped lead bipartisan effort to pass full assistance package for affected areas.
79 days after #Sandy devastated families, businesses &amp; communities, House action finally puts us a step closer to recovery.
Congratulations to @NYGovCuomo for signing into law the toughest state gun laws in the nation.  Proud NY is leading the way.
kudos to @RepLoBiondo for his strong advocacy for areas affected by #Sandy
@Daroff @jfederations @UJAfedNY It was a pleasure!
We must come together to help those who suffered devastating losses and rebuild stronger than ever. #Sandy
The House will soon begin debate on providing aid needed by families, bizes, communities to recover and rebuild from #Sandy
Speaking at Rules Committee on importance of passing #Sandy aid to help region recover &amp; rebuild: http://t.co/e3vtnDfq
See you there.  Inexcusable.  MT: @repjoecrowley Heading to Floor to speak out against #GOP ?s failure to bring up #Sandy aid bill.
House GOP leadership decision to adjourn Congress without considering #Sandy aid is irresponsible and inexcusable.
No compromise is perfect, but failing to pass this deal only ensures higher tax bills and reduced economic growth. (2/2)
House should vote immediately on Biden-McConnell compromise to avoid huge tax hike and damaging budget cuts.  (1/2)
Pleased the House will today consider emergency #Sandy relief - must pass full $60.4B passed by Senate to help region recover &amp; rebuild
NRA promised "meaningful contributions" to the debate on gun violence.  Instead they offer more guns, more violence.  Outrageous.
Looking forward to joining @HuffPostLive for a chat on the assault weapons ban - tune in!
Congrats to @SenatorBarb - first female chair of Appropriations.  Look forward to working together!
Please see my @HuffingtonPost column on reinstating the assault weapons ban and prohibiting high-capacity mags: http://t.co/rGN4BpLK
@DanPierson @matt_pierson Sorry for the inconvenience, I'm working on a fix to this.
Reinstate assault weapons ban, outlaw high-capacity magazines, strengthen bkgd checks, close gun show loophole (2/2)
Our sympathy for #Newtown victims and families must be matched by concrete actions to stop gun violence (1/2)
Praying for victims and families in Newtown, CT.  A senseless and heartbreaking tragedy.
#GOP leadership should #DoTheRightThing and vote now on extending middle-class tax cuts - an idea both parties support.

BTW only $44Bil of the $85Bil in cuts happen this budget year.  Real cut this year is just 1.2%
Perspective $85bil sequester is 2.3% reduction of the $3.46T spending projection.  Don't call it a budget- Senate hasn't passed one in 4yrs
The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline has jumped 45 cents in the past 33 days- time for a better energy policy.
In 2011 fed gov made est $115 billion in improper payments- where people received bens or payment that not entitled to or no docs #CutWaste

The President has disbanded his jobs Council after not meeting with them for a year. It's time to focus on the Economy not ignore it.

Cuts like these are not just misguided, they?re cruel. #EndHungerNow
That adds up to a cut of almost $1100/year for a family of four. That may not seem like much to a Congress that has a lot of millionaires.
If these cuts are applied solely to benefits, then all 47 million on SNAP would see an average cut of $24/person per month. #EndHungerNow
The Ryan budget actually cuts $135 billion from SNAP over 10 years. $135 billion. That?s not a haircut ? that?s a meat ax. #EndHungerNow
SNAP is not just a simple anti-hunger program, it is among the most effective &amp; efficient federal programs. #EndHungerNow
Yet the Ryan budget slashes SNAP once again. This should come as no surprise. #EndHungerNow
I would hope that any budget proposed in this Congress would, at the very least, do no harm to those who are struggling. #EndHungerNow
We almost eradicated hunger in America in the late 1970s, but hunger has been getting steadily worse in the decades since. #EndHungerNow
Over 50 mil hungry Americans; 17 mil are kids. Over 47 million rely on SNAP, to put food on their tables. #EndHungerNow
The Ryan budget not only does not #EndHungerNow, it actually makes hunger in America worse than it is today.
Budget resolutions are essentially moral documents. They lay out a vision of how each party sees the future. #EndHungerNow

We have had 3 rounds of cuts for 1 round of revenue increases. The notion that we've engaged in a balanced process is not the case.
.@ChrisVanHollen on the floor: "We have tried 4 times. How many times have our GOP colleagues tried to replace the #sequester? Zero."

Encouraged @BarackObama called for equal pay for equal work in his 2nd Inaugural &amp; State of the Union addresses. #EqualPayDay
That?s why I intro?d #PaycheckFairness Act, to close the wage gap &amp; ensure equal pay for equal work once &amp; for all! #EqualPayDay
Nearly 50 yrs after the Equal Pay Act, a woman still earns just 77? for every $ a man working a comparable job makes. #EqualPayDay

Talking to Cumberland Mayor Brian Grim &amp; Frostburg Mayor Robert Flanigan - &amp; the press! - on Western Md Jobs tour http://t.co/rDqKbk
A job that's a passport-if you're middle class, you can stay. If you want to get to middle class, you have a chance through hard work&amp;me
A passport means if you work hard, play by the rules, get an education &amp; a skillset, there will be a job in this country for you.
Agree people should have passports to travel &amp; see the world. Also want American people to have passports to middle class.

Under #PaycheckFairness Act, no longer would employers be able to use almost any reason for paying a woman less.
Women work hard every day, but we find that the rules are different &amp; rigged against us. #PaycheckFairness
I believe that in America if you work hard &amp; play by the rules, you should be able to get ahead #PaycheckFairness   
This budget is a reflection of our values &amp; priorities. And eliminating the wage gap should be one of those priorities. #PaycheckFairnes
Fired up!  Senate just passed my Paycheck Fairness Amendment to the FY 2014 Senate Budget Resolution. #PaycheckFairness

Glad the House today voted to prevent a government shutdown &amp;  overwhelmingly passed bipartisan Senate legislation.
Thats why I joined @SenatorBurr to cosponsor bipartisan Child Care Protection Act to help prevent &amp; deter child abuse http://t.co/6SulRL
As a social worker, I?ve seen first hand permanent scars that child abuse &amp; neglect leave on both the child &amp; their family.
When a parent goes to work or school, they need peace of mind that their child is in a safe &amp; healthy environment.

Over 800k health care industry jobs have been created since #Obamacare but the #GOP ignores the facts
Insurers can no longer drop women's coverage when they become pregnant. The #GOP will vote to #Repeal this right for the 37th time.

@CharlieBeyer RAISING tax rates drives growth?  Taxing something = less of something (smoking, carbon). Same for wealth #askrsc #sctweets
@CharlieBeyer And Obama has no plan for growth.   0.3% increase in GDP over 10 years raises more $ than his tax hikes #askrsc #sctweets
@CharlieBeyer The current tax rates generated record revenues in mid 2000s.  Growth is what drives revs, not tax rates. #askrsc #sctweets

Tonight I'll be on PBS NewsHour around 6:40 pm to discuss the President's #SOTU and my priorities in Congress moving forward.
Today I introduced legislation to require the annual budget submission of Pres. to include the cost-per-taxpayer of deficit for each year.
Obama mentioned...Debt: 2 times, Budget: 4 times, Obamacare: 1 time Spending: 3 times, Sequester: 1 time, Unemployment: 0 times #SOTU
In the 59 minutes President Obama spoke, the national debt went up $123.5 million and the US government spent $404 million. #SOTU
I oppose a mandatory increase in the minimum wage.  This hike would result in lost jobs and hurt the very people it is intended to help.
History shows that gun bans keep guns away from law abiding citizens, not criminals.
Heartbroken by the tragedy in Newtown but gun bans are not the answer. Focus needs to be on mental health, school security.
Tax increases are not the answer.  It is time to get serious about spending.
House Republicans have twice passed sequestration alternatives.  We should replace indiscriminate cuts with targeted spending reductions.
At the #SOTU with @RepToddYoung @RepWalorski @toddrokita  @SusanWBrooks http://t.co/4Gej6zrc
We need a discussion on how we handle mental health and school safety in our country. History shows gun bans aren't the solution. #SOTU
The President talks about reducing red tape for small businesses while paying for his health care proposals on their backs #SOTU
The real #SOTU: $16.4 trillion in debt and 7.9% unemployment
The President criticizes the sequester but forgets he insisted on it. House has passed an alternative twice. #SOTU

No expectant mother should be denied reasonable workplace accommodations during her pregnancy. RT to demand #PWFA now!

NEW TAX HIKES: Pres health care law = $1 trillion, Pres budget = $1.1 trillion, January 2013 = $600billion. #SpendingIsTheProblem
January 2013 - President Obama got his $600 billion in new tax hikes on the American people. #ObamaTaxHike
On this National Day of Prayer -- encouraged by: 2 Chronicles 7:14
President Obama?s health care law = $1 trillion in new tax hikes. #ObamaTaxHike
President Obama?s Budget = $1.1 trillion in new tax hikes. #ObamaTaxHike
Americans do not need another #ObamaTaxHike. We need fundamental, fair, pro-growth tax reform. House GOP are committed to this.

FACT: POTUS? budget adds 2 new tax increases to IRA &amp; 401(k) savers. A total tax increase of $14billion. #ObamaTaxHike
FACT: The President?s budget would double the tobacco tax ? a total tax increase of $78billion. #ObamaTaxHike
FACT: The President?s budget would raise the death tax from 40% to 45% - a total tax increase of $79billion. #ObamaTaxHike
POTUS? health care law will hurt #smallbiz &amp; their employees w/ higher costs, fewer choices. #FullRepeal
POTUS choosing to ignore the higher premiums; loss of current coverage plans; fewer full-time jobs; his tax on medical innovation.
POTUS says those already insured don?t need to worry about rest of health care law?s implementation.

The President's Plan = $8.2 trillion in new debt + $1.1 trillion in new taxes --&gt; Take more to spend more.
The priorities of the American people ? stronger economy &amp; a govt that lives within its means ? are not reflected in POTUS? budget.
The American people continue to ask that we tackle the nation?s fiscal &amp; economic challenges - POTUS chooses not to listen.
2 months late &amp; still POTUS settles on a plan that saddles the public w/ higher taxes, more debt &amp; less economic opportunity.
POTUS calls his budget ?fiscally responsible.? Does $964 billion in NEW spending &amp; $8.2 trillion in NEW debt sound responsible to you?
Obama?s budget ignores America?s most significant fiscal &amp; economic challenges. http://t.co/p2YoqmvUre

Thanks to Sen. McConnell for coming down to support the filibuster and for helping save the floor for me tonight.
My fellow Kentucky Senator, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, has joined me on the floor to filibuster the nomination of John Brennan.
Sen. Cruz reading Tweets from all of you meant a lot to me. Protecting the Constitution is everyone's fight.
Are we going to use the standard that the 5th Amendment applies when we think it applies, but doesn't apply when we don't think it applies?
The President is advocating a drone strike program in America. All we have to compare it with is the drone strike program overseas.
They shouldn't just drop a hellfire missile on your caf? experience.
I don't know how to halfway believe you should declare war. I don't know how to halfway believe in the Fifth Amendment.
It's not enough to say 'I don't intend to break the Constitution.' You either believe in the Constitution or you don't.
I just can't imagine the President can't answer these questions, and its not enough to say 'I have no intention to do so.'
Even under George W. Bush, no one maintained that you could kill Americans at home.
If you have no bounds, you have an unlimited, imperial presidency.
Does the President have the power to decide when the Bill of Rights applies?
The government has defined 'terrorist' in this country to include things that might not include terrorists.
When your government won't tell you they don't have the power to do something, they're telling you they do have that power.
There have been those who say "you don't get a lawyer, shut up!" That's what we're moving towards.
I'm not a great fan of Jane Fonda. But I'm not so interested in putting her on a drone kill list either.
The American people deserve a clear statement from the President concerning limits of executive power.
Since we began this today I've had no communication from the White House or Attorney General.
Our right, as an American, to be tried in a court by our peers, should not be given up on.
One of the things we have to ask: What kind of standard will there be? If we're going to kill Americans in America, what kind of standard?
This conversation is about whether or not, in America, some rights are so special that we cannot give up.
We should try people for treason. It's one of the four crimes given to the federal courts in the Constitution.
It's harder to defeat an enemy if the entire world is a battlefield.
Here's that Eugene Robinson column: Judicial review needed for drone hits of citizens - San Antonio Express-News http://t.co/ZyR3sq7IHd
Bush started this, Obama is expanding this. The irony is that Obama ran as the anti-Bush candidate.
If you give up your rights now, don't expect to get them back.
I don't know how you can argue that we have exemptions to the Bill of Rights, whenever you want to.
We've always allowed a great deal of dissent in our country.
The President has shown no regard for the individual rights of Americans.
Do we not get the opportunity to explain ourselves in a court of law before we get a hellfire missile dropped on our heads?

What are we fighting for if we're not going to protect our rights at home? #filiblizzard http://t.co/rbFgPvxPPB
I will not sit quietly and let President Obama shred the Constitution. #filiblizzard
It worries me that they refuse to answer my questions, because by refusing to answer, I believe that they believe they have unlimited power.
What happened to candidate Obama who wanted to protect your right to privacy? He now doesn't care about your right to judicial proceeding.
Why isn't there more moral outrage? Why isn't every Senator coming down to say let's go ahead and hold this nomination?
Why don't we advise the pres. that he should come forward &amp; say he will not condone nor believe he has the authority to kill noncombatan

For those wondering why I voted against background checks legislation that I support, please read this: https://t.co/CimuFl42er
We are not giving up, and this is not over. I will do everything I can to continue our efforts to pass stronger background checks.
Current immigration issues are tearing apart families every single day, and the Senate must address them in a timely manner.
I applaud my 8 colleagues for producing commonsense plan to reform broken immigration system. Will do everything I can to pass this bill.
I will vote for assault weapons ban because maintaining law and order and saving lives is more important than preventing imagined tyranny.
Claims that our legislation would create a gun registry are nothing more than shameful scare tactics. Page 27 bans it http://t.co/zsc8U6rO2d
I'm heading to the floor to discuss how I will vote on key gun safety proposals including the assault weapons ban. http://t.co/XDK3ppnif5
It?s time to vote. Tomorrow at 4 pm, Senators will vote up or down on background checks, assault weapons ban, and high-capacity clip ban.
I commend the first responders and observers who rushed toward danger to help those who were hurt.
I will do whatever I can to support the people of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts during this difficult time.
The American people won?t tolerate obstruction of sensible background checks legislation. I hope Republicans will work with us.
I?m on my way to floor to hold a vote so we can begin debate on gun safety reforms. This is the beginning, not the end. Need your support!

I?m glad that there are some Republicans who agree that we should have a debate on gun violence prevention. http://t.co/nzbz9TLMZ1
It?s common sense that felons who can't pass background check in a gun store shouldn't be able to walk into gun show and buy deadly weapons.
Most gun owners are good, responsible people, who love target shooting and hunting or want to protect their homes and families.
There's no reason for blatant GOP obstruction except fear of considering anti-violence proposals in public view
Every idea to curb gun violence should be debated and get a vote: stronger background checks, ban on assault weapons, among others
Today we recall the 6M Jews and others, tragically murdered during the Holocaust, and renew the call to fight genocide, hatred &amp; oppress

The Ryan Republican plan reminds me of a scene from Groundhog Day. Haven?t we already rejected this approach? http://t.co/x1trWBWjXx
Dem budget reduces deficit &amp; closes tax loopholes for the rich. It creates jobs and invests in education and infrastructure.
#Ryanbudget takes aim at health care ? it ends Medicare as we know it and eliminates free preventive health services for 34M Americans.
The #Ryanbudget is anything but balanced, and it reflects the same backward values Americans rejected in November.
.@RepPaulRyan budget cuts will give more tax breaks to the wealthiest among us. This budget isn't a serious attempt to reduce the deficit.
@PattyMurray will intro budget that encourages a strong middle class, cuts wasteful spending and closes tax loopholes that benefit the rich.
Dems believe it is critical that we stabilize the deficit. But it will take more than accounting gimmicks to achieve real deficit reduction.
#Ryanbudget also showers tax breaks on millionaires and continues to tilt the playing field to the advantage of big corporate interests
#Ryanbudget ends Medicare as we know it, cuts education and programs that help the economy, shifts burden to seniors and middle class

It's critical that Republicans and Democrats come together to find a balanced way to avert sequester cuts. 750,000 jobs across U.S. at stake
Republicans voted to impose cuts. Now an overwhelming majority of Americans want us to compromise, find a balanced approach.
In NV, cuts could mean 120 teachers to lose jobs, local law enforcement loses resources, and thousands of DOD employees get furloughs.
Dem plan: smart spending reductions, close loopholes, end wasteful corp. tax subsidies and ask wealthiest to pay their fair share.
To give our economy a foundation for growth, Congress must replace arbitrary sequester cuts with a balanced approach to deficit reduction.

My statement on the President?s fifth State of the Union address: http://t.co/a4STVBJ3 #SOTU
House Rs should make #VAWA a priority and pass it without delay. ~160 million American women are waiting to see action on this proposal.
Today, the Senate stood up for women across the country by reauthorizing Violence Against Women Act #VAWA with strong bipartisan majority
If Rs agree that these cuts would be damaging to our #economy and #nationalsecurity, they should work with us to pass an alternative.
A balanced approach of sensible spending reductions w/ modest contributions from the wealthiest would prevent damage of so-called sequester
President Obama will also propose a balanced alternative to the devastating, automatic spending cuts set to take effect next month.
Tonight President Obama will chart a course to maintain economic progress we?ve made and revive a still-struggling #middleclass.

CA Latinas receive even less: just 42 cents on the dollar! Requires working 28+ months to match yearly earnings of white men #equalpay
#WOC are especially hurt by the gender pay gap: Black women working FT in CA are paid just 64 cents for every $ paid to white men. #equalpay
Why #equalpay now? In CA, working women collectively lose $37B each yr due to pay inequalities--$ that our families and communities need
A year of unequal pay=4 months of groceries, 5 months of child care, AND 6+ months of rent + utilities #equalpay
Un #equalpay impacts women &amp; families across lifespan. Lower lifetime earnings=lower soc. security payments &amp; greater retirement ins
#Equalpay is necessary for family economic security.When both parents are paid fairly, the whole family benefits.
.@ChadFran No, not a zero sum game. #Equalpay helps men too when moms, grandmas, wives &amp; sisters are paid fairly b/c net family wages go

MT @speakerboehner: House continues to wait for Senate to act. @GOPWhip has advised Members to stay near Capitol in case of further votes
For talking about reducing spending so often, the President's actions sure don't back it up. We have a spending problem, not a revenue one.
Back in DC. The President and Senator Reid must recognize we have to protect families from tax hikes AND tackle out of control spending.
RIP General Norman Schwarzkopf - thank you for your decades of service to our great nation "Stormin' Norman"
The House has already passed legislation averting the #FiscalCliff, time for Senator Reid and the President to pass something...

#NM has one of the smallest wage gaps for Hispanic women, but they still only make 68? to every 1$ paid 2 men-they deserve #paycheckfairness
#NM women make 79? 4 every 1$ a man makes--higher than the 77? natl avg, but still not equal. That's why I support a #paycheckfairness bill

It's even worse than we thought: revised analysis (http://t.co/42vwEPE8Le) shows #GOPBudget gives avg millionaire $245K in tax breaks.
2/3rds of the cuts in #GOPBudget come from programs for those w/low or moderate incomes (via @CenterOnBudget) http://t.co/PynTGdsTLo
The #GOPbudget provides an avg tax cut of at least $200,000 for millionaires and could stick middle class families with a $2K bill.
Promising news on the campaign finance front: http://t.co/1misN7Ugj1 -- Hopefully the Court will hold the FEC's feet to the fire.
#GOPBudget more than doubles sequester's cuts to nondefense discretionary. Kids ed., science research, etc will see drastic cuts.
A #BalancedBudget is important?but doing so on the backs of seniors&amp;by slashing critical investments in near term is not how to do it
Budgets are statements of values &amp; priorities. GOP making theirs clear today: protect tax breaks for special interests, wealthy, big oil
#GOPbudget assumes full repeal of ObamaCare, but uses its ~$2T in savings to get to balance in 10yrs. Can't have it both ways. #Hoax.
This year's #GOPbudget is a lot like last year's - bad news for seniors &amp; the economy, great news for millionaires and big oil.

POLL: a majority of Americans want to reduce the deficit in a balanced way. http://t.co/Xe1L20ezu3
TOMORROW, 4pm: twitter town hall on sequester's impact on MD. Tweet Q's using #AskMDDems.
Non-partisan CBO says 750,000 jobs will be lost if sequester hits. Not a 'scare tactic' - just reality.  #StopTheSequester
Spkr B., bills from last Congress cannot be taken up in this Congress. Leg. Process 101. Enough w/the posterior politics. #StopTheSequester
I have offered the Dem plan to #StopTheSequester 3x so far this Congress. GOP has offered nothing. T-3 days til sequester.
Tweaking how sequester cuts are implemented is like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. 750K jobs will be lost either way (per CBO).
Just submitted (for 3rd time) Dem plan to #StopTheSequester. The American ppl want a balanced approach - they deserve a vote.
Q: What is the definition of "#sequester"? A: http://t.co/qBsfmzeAow
4 days til sequester. Will GOP come to the table or will they continue fighting to protect tax loopholes?
If the sequester goes through, gun background checks may suffer - http://t.co/3vX0PSTet0
FACT: Republicans haven't offered a plan to replace the sequester in this Congress. @HouseDemocrats have. http://t.co/ROHfr1Yo3t
Republicans want the sequester. Democrats want a solution. @SpeakerBoehner, keep the House in session so we can avert this crisis.
As POTUS said in his #SOTU address, the time is now for Congress to move #forwardonclimate. http://t.co/pWUR6LzU
Agree w/@RepJustinAmash - GOP should spend less time thinking up lame hashtags &amp; more time coming up with solutions. http://t.co/e4ue4BA
Just intro'd Dem plan to replace sequester w/mix of cuts + revenues from Buffett Rule &amp; by ending big oil/ag subsidies http://t.co/TrMjm
If the automatic spending cuts hit on March 1, CBO est. 750K jobs will be lost this year. Americans deserve better - http://t.co/DTPnj9a0
GOP must stop scapegoating federal employees. They've already contributed more than their fair share to reducing the deficit.
Yesterday, for the 4th time, the GOP refused to allow a vote on the Dem plan (http://t.co/H6rcBWm8) to avert the #SequesterCrisis.
Today, #ValentinesDay, is the 2 month anniversary of #Newtown. Send a Valentine for @SandyHook: http://t.co/yWqzeBP3 #1MillionHearts

Pres. Obama made one thing perfectly clear tonight: an economy is grown from the middle out, not from the top down. #SOTU
Agree w/ POTUS re: need to invest in middle class. Goal of deficit reduction must be to grow econ, not European-style austerity. #SOTU

Just 8 legislative days left before the sequester hits and the do-nothing GOP is, well, doing nothing.
We should be focused like a laser on jobs and the economy - not playing political games.  http://t.co/Y532EESz
Thx to #FMLA, you can no longer lose your job should you need to take leave due to your or a family member's illness.
CBO budget outlook makes 1 thing clear- a balanced approach is a must if we want to stabilize&amp;grow the econ.  http://t.co/pNs5LUq3
Dems feel it's irresponsible to let the meat ax sequester cuts go fwd. R's wld rather play political games than prevent them.
GOP wasting another week w/gimmicks, slogans &amp; hashtags instead of being responsible &amp; dealing w/sequester. Time is running out.

Raising the debt limit doesn't authorize new spending. It simply lets the US pay its bills &amp; make good on commitments it's already made.

#NRA's LaPierre took no Qs at his press conference b/c even he can't explain why anyone would ever need a high-capacity assault weapon.
Truly scary that the tea party GOP will fight to give millionaires $50k in bonus breaks even if it means driving the country off the cliff.
.@SpeakerBoehner's "Plan B" would give millionaires an avg tax cut of $50K. How's that for compromise? #MerryCliffmas
GOP sked'ing another vote on their unpoplar Reconciliation bill that
By voting on his Plan B &amp; Reconciliation cuts, Spkr Boehner is
.@SpeakerBoehner's "Plan B" = the latest example of the GOP walking away from negotiations. The "B" must stand for "Backing out."

The President has laid out specific cuts and revenues. Time for @SpeakerBoehner to do the same: http://t.co/URXCXd0U
178 signatures on the petition to force a vote on extending middle class tax cuts. 218 needed. Keep track: http://t.co/khsFp4fl #my2k
Disappointed in Senate GOP for blocking ratification of #UNCRPD treaty. Rights for persons w/ disabilities should be a bipartisan value.
Tmrw Dems will petition to force vote on tax cuts for middle class, who shouldn't have to suffer b/c of a GOP-manufactured stalemate.

ICYMI: My thoughts on the President's #SOTU address. http://t.co/CpNakoWy
As Vice-Chair of the Subcommittee on Energy I strongly encourage you to watch the live coverage. Starts at 10am... http://t.co/nqJvChRT
Sharing my reaction with local networks - make sure to catch the various coverage, #sotu http://t.co/Uou5oUx1
guns are not the enemy #sotu
Obama wants to limit 2nd amendment freedom... Mr President: here's a fact: Guns don't cause crime anymore than computers cause porno.#sotu.
#POTUS executive orders are not the answer. He should be working with Congress. #SOTU
Obama says his administration has kept Congress informed bout terrorism operations... Has he forgotten Benghazi? Or was it a film? #sotu.rw
Now Obama wants to dictate to businesses what they have to pay... Hmmm... He must think he's a dictator... Sad huh? #sotu
Let's get more boots on the ground and secure our border #sotu
The govt's 1st involvement that caused housing bubble burst wasn't enough, Obama wants to wade back in. Relax rules... He's a slow learner
lower taxes and less regulations will help our job creators #SOTU
We need to fix the debt first #POTUS - #SOTU
Obama says if Congress won't act, he will. Another end around Congress is on its way. For a lawyer he sure doesn't know our Constitution!
combat climate change? I hear more burdensome regulations from the EPA #SOTU #morejobs #lessregulation
Let's put political differences aside...couldn't agree more #POTUS...APPROVE the Keystone Pipeline already #SOTU
We don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem... #SOTU
Mr. President, the sequester was your idea...remember? http://t.co/ZBHJCgmh #SOTU
We can encourage our free enterprise by reducing burdensome regulations and a fairer tax code not from a larger government #SOTU
