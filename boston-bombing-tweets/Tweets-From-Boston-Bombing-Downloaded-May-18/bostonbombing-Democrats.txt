Background checks legislation will get passed. Just a matter of time. I assure the 90% who support it that I will continue this fight.
For those wondering why I voted against background checks legislation that I support, please read this: https://t.co/CimuFl42er
We are not giving up, and this is not over. I will do everything I can to continue our efforts to pass stronger background checks.
Current immigration issues are tearing apart families every single day, and the Senate must address them in a timely manner.
I applaud my 8 colleagues for producing commonsense plan to reform broken immigration system. Will do everything I can to pass this bill.
I will vote for assault weapons ban because maintaining law and order and saving lives is more important than preventing imagined tyranny.
Claims that our legislation would create a gun registry are nothing more than shameful scare tactics. Page 27 bans it http://t.co/zsc8U6rO2d
I'm heading to the floor to discuss how I will vote on key gun safety proposals including the assault weapons ban. http://t.co/XDK3ppnif5
It?s time to vote. Tomorrow at 4 pm, Senators will vote up or down on background checks, assault weapons ban, and high-capacity clip ban.
I commend the first responders and observers who rushed toward danger to help those who were hurt.
I will do whatever I can to support the people of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts during this difficult time.
The American people won?t tolerate obstruction of sensible background checks legislation. I hope Republicans will work with us.
My thoughts &amp; prayers are w/ Boston. If you're trying to track down a loved one in Boston, police say you can call (617) 635-4500.
