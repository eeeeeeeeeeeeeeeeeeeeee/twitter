My thoughts and prayers go out to those in Boston right now. God bless you all.
Today marks 18 years since the OKC bombing. We will never forget the images of that fateful day that shook families and communities forever.
In 1900, the tax rate was 5.9%. Today, the tax burden is $4.22 trillion or 29.4% of total income.
Today is Tax Freedom Day. It takes 108 days for total American income to cover the total tax bill of $4.22 trillion.
Despite damage, I am grateful to hear that there are no serious injuries reported in southwest OK after a long night of severe weather.
My thoughts and prayers are with Boston today and all the victims affected by yesterday's horrific marathon bombing.

I commend the brave first responders in Boston, and the kind and generous spirit of all of those Bostonians, and others, who rushed to help.
I extend my deepest sympathies and my prayers to the families and loved ones of all of those killed and injured in this heartless attack.
...nor will they escape our system of justice.
But this terrorist, or group of terrorists, whether foreign or domestic, will never succeed in robbing us of our way of life...
...an act of terror destroyed lives and shattered a sense of security,
On a day when friends &amp; families gathered, traveling from all over the world to celebrate and strive for greatness...
What happened in Boston is quite simply ? unimaginable.

Will be speaking with @CNNsotu at 9:25 am this morning about why the Boston suspect should be held as an enemy combatant. #scnews
Now speaking with Fox News about Boston suspect and enemy combatant status.
About to speak on-air with Fox News about Boston bombing.
A decision to NOT read Miranda rights to the suspect was sound and in our national security interests.
Under the Law of War, suspect must be humanely treated, consistent w/ the Detainee Treatment Act, domestic law, and the Geneva Conventions.
As to any future trial, if this suspect is an American citizen, he is NOT subject to military commission trial. #Boston
An enemy combatant is entitled to a habeas hearing before a federal judge with appointment of a counsel. Usually, w/in 30 days of capture.
In a case like #Boston, it could take weeks to prepare the questions needed to be asked &amp; months before intelligence gathering is comple
The questioning of an enemy combatant for national security purposes has no limit on time or scope.
American citizens who take up arms against our nation or collaborate with our enemies HAVE been held as enemy combatants.
Just released this statement with @KellyAyotte @SenJohnMcCain and @RepPeteKing about Boston / enemy combatant.. https://t.co/0i4Utv7EO9
Under the Law of War we can hold #Boston suspect as a potential enemy combatant not entitled to Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel.
...criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim, and kill innocent Americans.#Boston
The accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise....

Just put out this statement with @SenJohnMcCain about #Boston suspect and #Miranda warning.  http://t.co/FZ4FKUb37w
I hope the Obama Administration will seriously consider this option. #Boston
The goal is to gather intelligence and protect our nation which is under threat from radical Islam. #Boston
The Law of War allows us to hold individual in this scenario as potential enemy combatant w/o Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel.
The least of my worries is a criminal trial which will likely be held years from now. #Boston
We should be focused on preventing possible attacks over the coming hours and days.  #Boston
It is vital he be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes about possible future plots. #Boston
Now that the suspect is in custody, the last thing I want is for him to remain silent. #Boston
I appreciate the hard work and bravery  of our law enforcement and intelligence communities. #Boston
@washpost Boston bombing is 'Exhibit 'A' of why the homeland is the battlefield http://t.co/ed7t0jjzOu
The Obama Administration needs to be contemplating these issues and should not rush into a bad decision.
The last thing we may want to do is read Boston suspect Miranda Rights telling him to "remain silent."
If the #Boston suspect has ties to overseas terror organizations he could be treasure trove of  information.
If captured, I hope Administration will at least consider holding the Boston suspect as enemy combatant for intelligence gathering purposes.

My #Gangof8 colleagues are explaining their immigration reform proposal, which I will fight for. Watch: http://t.co/HYWyPIBIjD #TimeIsNow
Background checks legislation will get passed. Just a matter of time. I assure the 90% who support it that I will continue this fight.
For those wondering why I voted against background checks legislation that I support, please read this: https://t.co/CimuFl42er
We are not giving up, and this is not over. I will do everything I can to continue our efforts to pass stronger background checks.
Current immigration issues are tearing apart families every single day, and the Senate must address them in a timely manner.
I applaud my 8 colleagues for producing commonsense plan to reform broken immigration system. Will do everything I can to pass this bill.
I will vote for assault weapons ban because maintaining law and order and saving lives is more important than preventing imagined tyranny.
Claims that our legislation would create a gun registry are nothing more than shameful scare tactics. Page 27 bans it http://t.co/zsc8U6rO2d
I'm heading to the floor to discuss how I will vote on key gun safety proposals including the assault weapons ban. http://t.co/XDK3ppnif5
It?s time to vote. Tomorrow at 4 pm, Senators will vote up or down on background checks, assault weapons ban, and high-capacity clip ban.
I commend the first responders and observers who rushed toward danger to help those who were hurt.
I will do whatever I can to support the people of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts during this difficult time.
The American people won?t tolerate obstruction of sensible background checks legislation. I hope Republicans will work with us.
