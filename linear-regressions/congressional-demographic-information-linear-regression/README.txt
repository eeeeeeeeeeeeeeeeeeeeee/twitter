This contains tables that make it easy to do linear regression in
Excel/MATLAB.  The regression is done between congressional demographic
variables (age, party, gender, status) and Twitter data (number of
followers, number following, number tweets per month, number of followers
per capita, number following per capita).  Followers and following per
capita is screwed up due to rounding errors.
