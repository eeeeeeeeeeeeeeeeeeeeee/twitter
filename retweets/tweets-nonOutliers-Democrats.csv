I have no doubt that his legacy will motivate more Ohioans to continue our state's proud tradition of leadership in aerospace.
Neil inspired so many Americans
The last time I spoke with him, we discussed the need to instill a love for science and math in young people.
But like any pioneer, he wasn't content to rest on his achievements - he was focused on the future.
Neil Armstrong was a pioneer in human space exploration and will always be remembered as Ohio's own and the first man to walk on the moon.

@TheBigChezy anyone who puts obamaphone on their top 10 list for fiscal responsibility is pushing message, not being serious.
@TheBigChezy Well, I'll give you big points for staying on message. Not so much for policy analysis or real fiscal responsibility.
@TheBigChezy Obama phones? That's at the top of your list? Not reducing healthcare inflation? You're really interested in fiscal policy?

@TheBigChezy Just say where.
@FreedomsSon Inflation!! Right. Haven't seen much of it in last 5 years. So do you give Obama credit for keeping that "tax" low?
@libertytreeman And is it your belief that calling people names strengthens or weakens the power of your argument? Just curious.
@libertytreeman Everybody who is owed money by the gov gets paid. That's why we call it "full faith and credit".
@libertytreeman No I don't. I never said that. I say we pay ALL our bills. As we always have.
@FreedomsSon and by you guys, you mean Reagan, Bush and Bush, right? Cause that's when debt really grew as a % of our economy.
@FreedomsSon Taxes are as low as a % of our economy as they've been since the late 50s.
Merely bringing #paychinafirst to the floor will create questions in financial markets about our willingness to stand by our commitments.
We should argue about what bills we incur and how much we tax. That's our job. But as Washington and Hamilton knew we should PAY OUR BILLS.

@alexisgoldstein @anatadmati @rortybomb SL crisis caused by dumb lending. Equity, forex, irs derivatives not in any way involved.
@alexisgoldstein @anatadmati @rortybomb So would you argue against banks participating in commercial real estate? Done more damage.
@alexisgoldstein @anatadmati @rortybomb No, I choose my words carefully. That was the FSLIC, not FDIC. FSLIC now disbanded.
@alexisgoldstein @anatadmati @rortybomb Still, the probability of such a disaster generated by equity derivatives is close to nil.
@alexisgoldstein @anatadmati @rortybomb Has never happened. And if it did, reserve would be replenished through industry assessment.
@alexisgoldstein According to twitter he lives in DC, so not likely a constituent. And yes, when people don't research I will raise that.
@alexisgoldstein Plausible is a pretty thin thread on which to hang a charge of absence of integrity.
@alexisgoldstein I'm fascinated with the pride of those who believe that those who disagree are either stupid, inattentive or corrupt.
@alexisgoldstein And re "captured by banks" is it possible we've thought this through and have a different opinion than you do?
@alexisgoldstein @repdavidscott Moreover 992 does not exempt asset backed or structured swaps from push out.
@alexisgoldstein @repdavidscott The AFR info is simply inaccurate. S 716 prohibits fed reserve support. FDIC is not taxpayer $, it's bank $.

@wriemer so I'm told.
@wriemer Ah, very good snark. Like the Goldman angle. Always a crowd pleaser. Only problem is I never called anyone a coward.
Had long talk w @ChuckSchumer on immigration reform. While not perfect, this is a GOOD bill for US. It starts moving in May. Advocate now!
@scottryanwill fair points, but I think there is a line between being critical of your opponents and being "self righteous".
@StevePosick @chrismurphyct It most certainly does not. Show me any data that proves causality. Post hoc ergo propter hoc is bad logic.
@adriamc And yes, you did. There is no ambiguity in "I was going to ask who paid for his vote".
@adriamc #cispa requires gov minimization of PII, forbids use 4 "national security" has civilian entry. Work to do, but it's a better bill
@adriamc @fatdaninc Ah, yes. The presumption that those we disagree with are corrupt. Our founders would be so proud.
@ScottBonz Not true. Nothing in #cispa forces employers to do anything, much less disclose passwords. This amendment was not germane to bill
@ScottBonz not at all. My amendment requires govt PII minimization, bill is much improved relative to last congress. Read it.
Joined @MayorBillFinch and many labor leaders in Bridgeport to mark the 26th anniversary of the L'Ambiance disaster which killed 28 workers.

#LWCF key to protecting Great Smoky Mountains in west, Cape Hatteras National Seashore in east, &amp; all of our state?s natural gems in bet
Proud to co-sponsor bipartisan bill to support #LWCF to preserve NC?s parks, green spaces &amp; public lands, all of which support jobs in N
Proud to co-sponsor resolution recognizing @rarediseaseday. My TREAT Act brings hope to patients w life-threatening &amp; #rarediseases
I will be working with Ds and Rs to still get a long-term solution before worst effects of sequestration hit NC
The middle-class shouldn't have to keep paying price for Washington's dysfunction. We need to meet in the middle &amp; get something done
Congress also should not give POTUS authority to pick &amp; choose which programs to cut. Congress must still do its job
Neither #sequestration bill offered a long-term solution. DC can't keep operating on patchwork solutions
Pleased that the House has finally passed #VAWA on bipartisan basis. This is good news for women &amp; families in NC
@FaithNPolitics the honor is mine. Can't wait to join you for this incredible pilgrimage #FPI2013
I saw firsthand last month the great work that Charlotte Bridge Home is doing for our vets everyday
I'm inspired by Brad Snyder's story of courage. Our wounded vets frequently overcome incredibly difficult challenges http://t.co/Ji8FBdqP9N

CBC's budget protects and enhances Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, SNAP, TANF &amp; other vital safety net programs for families
CBC's Budget doesnt endorse any specific recommendations of Simpson Bowles, but supports the goals of a $4 trillion, 10yr deficit reduction
The CBC Budget raises $1 trillion in new revenue to avoid sequestration, the self-inflicted economic disaster.
The CBC Budget proposes significant investments to accelerate our economic recovery and ensure that our recovery is felt in every community
The CBC Alternative Budget for 2014 puts forth a plan that reduces the deficit and alleviates harm inflicted by austerity measures
The CBC has a long history of submitting fiscally sound and socially responsible alternatives to budgets proposed by both Repubs &amp; Dem
Let?s have a budget that reflects our values
Democrats have a fair, balanced plan to cut spending responsibly, increase revenues, &amp; create growth with jobs.
The Republican fiscal plan claims to protect Medicare while ending it for future seniors.
To pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, it could raise taxes on middle class families by as much as $2,000 per year.
The Republican budget will result in 2 million fewer American jobs next year alone, decrease GDP 1.7 percent, &amp; stall our nation?s recov
Republican Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan builds on the failed proposals of the last two years by making them worse.
The Republican approach to the budget is putting millionaires and billionaires ahead of the middle class
The Repubs approach to the budget is the same as its approach to the sequester: protecting special interests rather than solving problems.
The Ryan Republican budget is ending the Medicare guarantee and shifting costs to seniors.
The Ryan Republican budget is undermining the health and economic security of the elderly and disabled.
The Ryan Republican budget is protecting the wealthiest at the expense of the middle class.
The Ryan Republican budget will Destroy jobs and put our economic recovery at risk.
The Ryan Republican budget is nothing more than more of the same plan that the American people rejected last fall.
Instead of targeting those in our  vulnerable communities, Republicans should work with Democrats towards  balanced and bipartisan solutions
Mr. Ryan finally appears willing to accept that revenues must be part of any solution to achieve real deficit reduction.
It again ends the Medicare guarantee, and shifts costs onto seniors.
The budget again includes trillions in undisclosed &amp; ambiguous spending cuts with little explanation of the policies required to affect

Section 5 of the #VotingRightsAct is constitutional. #VRA
Section 5 prohibits voting changes that have either the "purpose" or the "effect" of denying the right to vote on account of race. #VRA
Although the South?s culture has changed in the past 48 year the need for the #VotingRightsAct has not.
The #VotingRightsAct protects against "packing" black voters unnecessarily into safe districts.
Congress reaffirmed the validity of the #VotingRightsAct 6 yrs ago.The Supreme Court shouldnt take away this protection for minority voters.
The #VotingRightsAct is the "crown jewel" of the civil rights law.
The #VotingRightsAct was enacted to stop partisanship. This effort to strike it down is partisan misbehavior.
District lines can?t be gerrymandered in ways that weaken the electoral power of minorities. The #VotingRightsAct protects this.
The #VotingRightsAct was necessary in the 2012 general election to protect against discrimination like voter ID laws.
Voters still face disenfranchisement.E.g- a San Antonio district was redrawn in 2003 to keep 100k Latinos out and a Republican in #VRA

While no law or set of laws will end gun violence, it is clear that the American people want action. @NowWithAlex
@nowwithalex The safety of America and its children should be at the forefront when it comes to making these gun safety laws

@NowWithAlex Congress must rise above partisan politics &amp; now come together to pass these important gun safety laws
At Today's Gun Task Force hearing. We must stop gun violence NOW!!!! http://t.co/SD0X5wVv
In one year on average, almost 100,000 people in America are shot or killed with a gun.
I have again introduced the Child Gun Safety and Gun Access Prevention Act in the 113th Congress.
I am focused on making sure that we take steps to identify and treat people who have mental illness b4 they can harm themselves or others
What happened just over a month ago in Newtown was an unimaginable tragedy. What happens now is up to each of us here in Congress.
I commend the President for taking immediate and concrete steps today to reduce gun violence.
I look forward to working with Pres Obama and the House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force to find sensible solutions to reduce gun violence
4 families of the victims of Sandy Hook, of every massacre and every incident of gun violence, there is simply no time to waste
Pres proposals reflect a series of clear and concrete steps in the effort to rein in, reduce, and prevent gun violence in our country.
Hearing on gun violence is complete. President?s gun proposals offer conrcrete steps. Congress should pass NOW!!!! http://t.co/Lrzpd5qM
It is now Congress?s responsibility to work with the President to move forward with this plan, which is based on common-sense ideas.
If even one child?s life can be saved, then we need to act. Now is the time to do the right thing for our children and communities
I just asked about the importance of storing guns in your home in a safe place. #PreventGunViolence
Each day 33 Americans are murdered by firearms. Congress needs to put lives of our constituents over politics #PreventGunViolence
I agree with @BarackObama that #NowIsTheTime to work together to prevent gun violence
While no law or set of laws will end gun violence, it is clear that the American people want action.
Documents: Read President Obama's gun law proposals and list of executive actions http://t.co/8FOLVv5y
We must also look at gun violence in other cities too such as Chicago a number of school age kids have been killed with gun.
The safety of America and its children should be at the forefront when it comes to making these gun safety laws.

Cuts like these are not just misguided, they?re cruel. #EndHungerNow
That adds up to a cut of almost $1100/year for a family of four. That may not seem like much to a Congress that has a lot of millionaires.
If these cuts are applied solely to benefits, then all 47 million on SNAP would see an average cut of $24/person per month. #EndHungerNow
The Ryan budget actually cuts $135 billion from SNAP over 10 years. $135 billion. That?s not a haircut ? that?s a meat ax. #EndHungerNow
SNAP is not just a simple anti-hunger program, it is among the most effective &amp; efficient federal programs. #EndHungerNow
Yet the Ryan budget slashes SNAP once again. This should come as no surprise. #EndHungerNow
I would hope that any budget proposed in this Congress would, at the very least, do no harm to those who are struggling. #EndHungerNow
We almost eradicated hunger in America in the late 1970s, but hunger has been getting steadily worse in the decades since. #EndHungerNow
Over 50 mil hungry Americans; 17 mil are kids. Over 47 million rely on SNAP, to put food on their tables. #EndHungerNow
The Ryan budget not only does not #EndHungerNow, it actually makes hunger in America worse than it is today.
Budget resolutions are essentially moral documents. They lay out a vision of how each party sees the future. #EndHungerNow

What do you call doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results? RT @MomBug:"cognitive dissonance"
What do you call doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results? Costly. #Obamacare #37X #GOP
$20M of the $52M #Obamacare repeal vote could be restored to domestic violence funding that was cut this year.
$41M of that $52M #Obamacare repeal vote could pay for 19 million meals on wheels cut by the sequester. #37X.
The #GOP is wasting $52M on the obamacare repeal vote. What else could that pay for? A yr of Head Start for 6900 kids #37X

On #NWHW the #GOP will vote to #Repeal #Obamacare which gives 47 mil. women access to preventive services without cost sharing
#Repeal puts health insurance companies back in control of YOUR health care, increases costs and cuts benefits for #Medicare seniors
Over 800k health care industry jobs have been created since #Obamacare but the #GOP ignores the facts
Insurers can no longer drop women's coverage when they become pregnant. The #GOP will vote to #Repeal this right for the 37th time.
@GOP has decided to take a 37th pointless vote to #Repeal #Obamacare instead of focusing on a bill that creates American jobs

House #GOP is wasting YOUR time and tax dollars on a distortion and spin campaign to #repeal #obamacare
And now Benneton has signed #Bangladesh factory safety plan but still no .@Walmart , .@GAP , or .@jcpenney . Outrageous.

More than 105 million Americans no longer have lifetime dollar limits on their coverage but the #GOP wants to #repeal that
36 failed attempts to #Repeal #Obamacare have wasted 52 million of YOUR #tax dollars. That money could have restored cuts to #MealsOnWheels
Starting in 2014, health insurers will be prohibited from charging you more because you are a #woman but the #GOP is eager to #repeal that
36 failed attempts to #Repeal #Obamacare have wasted 52 million of YOUR tax dollars. That money could have funded #HeadStart for 6900 kids

I'll be on @hardball on MSNBC talking fiscal cliff. Tune in at 5:10pm!
I had hoped to support a balanced deal on the fiscal cliff. Unfortunately, last night's bill was far from balanced: http://t.co/ABxcapYP
#FiscalCliff bill provides massive tax cut for small % of wealthy in exchange for only a temporary extension of programs for middle class
I voted no on #fiscalcliff bill. Leaves US with 3 more 'fiscal cliffs' - all would put nearly 40% of Northern Va economy on chopping block.
I had hoped to cast a vote on a balanced #FiscalCliff deal. Unfortunately, this bill is wholly inadequate.

Seems that private property rights are only sacrosanct when they don?t interfere w/ the profits of foreign oil companies #Keystone #KXL
How much contempt do the authors of this legislation have for the people most directly affected by this pipeline? #Keystone #KXL
And we should be focused on developing renewable energy, not short-cutting environmental laws to mandate approval of a dirty pipeline #KXL
We cannot allow such a gigantic and irreversible step backward in the fight against global warming. #Keystone XL Pipeline #KXL #climate

More than 3 in 5 pregnant women provide income that is critical to the economic security of their family. We need #PWFA now!
#PWFA closes legal loopholes &amp; ensures fair treatment for pregnant workers, like the chance to use a stool or carry a water bottle
No expectant mother should be denied reasonable workplace accommodations during her pregnancy. RT to demand #PWFA now!
#PregnantWorkers shouldn't be forced out of a job b/c they're denied reasonable accommodations in the workplace. Pass #PWFA now!

For those wondering why I voted against background checks legislation that I support, please read this: https://t.co/CimuFl42er
We are not giving up, and this is not over. I will do everything I can to continue our efforts to pass stronger background checks.
Current immigration issues are tearing apart families every single day, and the Senate must address them in a timely manner.
I applaud my 8 colleagues for producing commonsense plan to reform broken immigration system. Will do everything I can to pass this bill.
I will vote for assault weapons ban because maintaining law and order and saving lives is more important than preventing imagined tyranny.
Claims that our legislation would create a gun registry are nothing more than shameful scare tactics. Page 27 bans it http://t.co/zsc8U6rO2d
I'm heading to the floor to discuss how I will vote on key gun safety proposals including the assault weapons ban. http://t.co/XDK3ppnif5
It?s time to vote. Tomorrow at 4 pm, Senators will vote up or down on background checks, assault weapons ban, and high-capacity clip ban.
I commend the first responders and observers who rushed toward danger to help those who were hurt.
I will do whatever I can to support the people of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts during this difficult time.
The American people won?t tolerate obstruction of sensible background checks legislation. I hope Republicans will work with us.
I?m on my way to floor to hold a vote so we can begin debate on gun safety reforms. This is the beginning, not the end. Need your support!

I?m glad that there are some Republicans who agree that we should have a debate on gun violence prevention. http://t.co/nzbz9TLMZ1
It?s common sense that felons who can't pass background check in a gun store shouldn't be able to walk into gun show and buy deadly weapons.
Most gun owners are good, responsible people, who love target shooting and hunting or want to protect their homes and families.
There's no reason for blatant GOP obstruction except fear of considering anti-violence proposals in public view
Every idea to curb gun violence should be debated and get a vote: stronger background checks, ban on assault weapons, among others

The Ryan Republican plan reminds me of a scene from Groundhog Day. Haven?t we already rejected this approach? http://t.co/x1trWBWjXx
Dem budget reduces deficit &amp; closes tax loopholes for the rich. It creates jobs and invests in education and infrastructure.
#Ryanbudget takes aim at health care ? it ends Medicare as we know it and eliminates free preventive health services for 34M Americans.
The #Ryanbudget is anything but balanced, and it reflects the same backward values Americans rejected in November.
.@RepPaulRyan budget cuts will give more tax breaks to the wealthiest among us. This budget isn't a serious attempt to reduce the deficit.
@PattyMurray will intro budget that encourages a strong middle class, cuts wasteful spending and closes tax loopholes that benefit the rich.
Dems believe it is critical that we stabilize the deficit. But it will take more than accounting gimmicks to achieve real deficit reduction.
#Ryanbudget also showers tax breaks on millionaires and continues to tilt the playing field to the advantage of big corporate interests
#Ryanbudget ends Medicare as we know it, cuts education and programs that help the economy, shifts burden to seniors and middle class

It's critical that Republicans and Democrats come together to find a balanced way to avert sequester cuts. 750,000 jobs across U.S. at stake
Republicans voted to impose cuts. Now an overwhelming majority of Americans want us to compromise, find a balanced approach.
In NV, cuts could mean 120 teachers to lose jobs, local law enforcement loses resources, and thousands of DOD employees get furloughs.
Dem plan: smart spending reductions, close loopholes, end wasteful corp. tax subsidies and ask wealthiest to pay their fair share.
To give our economy a foundation for growth, Congress must replace arbitrary sequester cuts with a balanced approach to deficit reduction.

House Rs should make #VAWA a priority and pass it without delay. ~160 million American women are waiting to see action on this proposal.
Today, the Senate stood up for women across the country by reauthorizing Violence Against Women Act #VAWA with strong bipartisan majority
If Rs agree that these cuts would be damaging to our #economy and #nationalsecurity, they should work with us to pass an alternative.
A balanced approach of sensible spending reductions w/ modest contributions from the wealthiest would prevent damage of so-called sequester
President Obama will also propose a balanced alternative to the devastating, automatic spending cuts set to take effect next month.
Tonight President Obama will chart a course to maintain economic progress we?ve made and revive a still-struggling #middleclass.

CA Latinas receive even less: just 42 cents on the dollar! Requires working 28+ months to match yearly earnings of white men #equalpay
#WOC are especially hurt by the gender pay gap: Black women working FT in CA are paid just 64 cents for every $ paid to white men. #equalpay
Why #equalpay now? In CA, working women collectively lose $37B each yr due to pay inequalities--$ that our families and communities need
A year of unequal pay=4 months of groceries, 5 months of child care, AND 6+ months of rent + utilities #equalpay
Un #equalpay impacts women &amp; families across lifespan. Lower lifetime earnings=lower soc. security payments &amp; greater retirement ins
#Equalpay is necessary for family economic security.When both parents are paid fairly, the whole family benefits.
.@ChadFran No, not a zero sum game. #Equalpay helps men too when moms, grandmas, wives &amp; sisters are paid fairly b/c net family wages go

The #GOPbudget wld con't to protect special tax breaks for big oil companies - tax breaks they don't need: http://t.co/YNVcl9ompx
An inconvenient truth: the #gopbudget would not balance in 10 yrs w/o revs from Obamacare (which it? http://t.co/NF8ugg5biH
Student loan debt is at an all time high.#GOPbudget would make it harder on students by doubling their interest rates http://t.co/xtgTQctOci
#GOPbudget would 1. Block grant Medicaid 2. Repeal Obamacare benefits 3. Replace Medicare with voucher program
#GOPbudget's 3-pronged approach to addressing healthcare costs: 1. take
#GOPBudget will cost nearly $6 trillion and offers no plausible way to pay for it - http://t.co/42vwEPE8Le

How the #DemBudget stacks up against the #GOPbudget: http://t.co/3q917Xf5Rz
FACT SHEET: Everything you need to know about the #DemBudget - http://t.co/b4KEQ7Kz8a
Analysis shows #GOPBudget blows~$6T hole in budget, financed in part by sticking middle class fams w/$3k tax bill. http://t.co/42vwEPE8Le
Pleased to introduce the House Dem budget today. Most important deficit we face is the jobs deficit. Read our plan: http://t.co/3bZ5q7gjYi
It's even worse than we thought: revised analysis (http://t.co/42vwEPE8Le) shows #GOPBudget gives avg millionaire $245K in tax breaks.
2/3rds of the cuts in #GOPBudget come from programs for those w/low or moderate incomes (via @CenterOnBudget) http://t.co/PynTGdsTLo
The #GOPbudget provides an avg tax cut of at least $200,000 for millionaires and could stick middle class families with a $2K bill.
Promising news on the campaign finance front: http://t.co/1misN7Ugj1 -- Hopefully the Court will hold the FEC's feet to the fire.
#GOPBudget more than doubles sequester's cuts to nondefense discretionary. Kids ed., science research, etc will see drastic cuts.
A #BalancedBudget is important?but doing so on the backs of seniors&amp;by slashing critical investments in near term is not how to do it
Budgets are statements of values &amp; priorities. GOP making theirs clear today: protect tax breaks for special interests, wealthy, big oil
#GOPbudget assumes full repeal of ObamaCare, but uses its ~$2T in savings to get to balance in 10yrs. Can't have it both ways. #Hoax.
This year's #GOPbudget is a lot like last year's - bad news for seniors &amp; the economy, great news for millionaires and big oil.

Thank you to @RepThompson for delivering on our Super Bowl wager! http://t.co/oFCHxUFc6I
Yesterday I submitted--for the 4th time--my plan to #StopTheSequester. The GOP--for the 4th time--denied it a vote in the People's House.
.@Carpe_Cervisia, We have proposed a balanced plan to dramatically cut annual deficits and to stabilize the debt to GDP ratio. #AskMDDems
.@jstrick10 House Dems have presented alternative budgets every year that Ryan has.  #AskMDDems
Noel, MoC's offices are subject to the same 5% sequester as other fed agencies. Same rules apply to us. #AskMDDems (2 of 2)
Q via email from Noel Shively: What is the personal impact of sequestration on members of Congress? Their staff? #AskMDDems (1 of 2)
Yes, Tom - federal pensions are exempt from sequestration. #AskMDDems (2 of 2)
Q via email from Tom Driver of Glen Burnie: Are federal pensions exempt from sequestration? #AskMDDems (1 of 2)
Ben, House Dems' balanced plan (denied a vote 3x): http://t.co/g2HdtjdbfM. Senate Dems' plan: http://t.co/akO3rDYmct. #AskMDDems (2 of 2)
Q via email from Ben Ness: What are proposals Democrats are offering to avoid sequestration? #AskMDDems (1 of 2)
.@jcoopermartin, @SpeakerBoehner must find a way to rein in the extreme elements of his caucus and take a balanced approach. #AskMDDems
.@BettyButterly @AskMDDems  nonpartisan CBO says no matter how you cut it, sequester = 750K fewer jobs. #AskMDDems
.@Wayneg19 $1.5T in cuts from spending caps; ending direct pmts/ag subsidies + other savings in Dem budget #AskMDDems
Twitter town hall TODAY at 4pm on impact of sequester in MD. Tag questions w/ #AskMDDems or email them to AskMDDems@gmail.com
POLL: a majority of Americans want to reduce the deficit in a balanced way. http://t.co/Xe1L20ezu3
TOMORROW, 4pm: twitter town hall on sequester's impact on MD. Tweet Q's using #AskMDDems.
Non-partisan CBO says 750,000 jobs will be lost if sequester hits. Not a 'scare tactic' - just reality.  #StopTheSequester
Spkr B., bills from last Congress cannot be taken up in this Congress. Leg. Process 101. Enough w/the posterior politics. #StopTheSequester
I have offered the Dem plan to #StopTheSequester 3x so far this Congress. GOP has offered nothing. T-3 days til sequester.
Tweaking how sequester cuts are implemented is like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. 750K jobs will be lost either way (per CBO).
Just submitted (for 3rd time) Dem plan to #StopTheSequester. The American ppl want a balanced approach - they deserve a vote.
Q: What is the definition of "#sequester"? A: http://t.co/qBsfmzeAow
4 days til sequester. Will GOP come to the table or will they continue fighting to protect tax loopholes?
If the sequester goes through, gun background checks may suffer - http://t.co/3vX0PSTet0
FACT: Republicans haven't offered a plan to replace the sequester in this Congress. @HouseDemocrats have. http://t.co/ROHfr1Yo3t
Republicans want the sequester. Democrats want a solution. @SpeakerBoehner, keep the House in session so we can avert this crisis.
As POTUS said in his #SOTU address, the time is now for Congress to move #forwardonclimate. http://t.co/pWUR6LzU
Agree w/@RepJustinAmash - GOP should spend less time thinking up lame hashtags &amp; more time coming up with solutions. http://t.co/e4ue4BA
Just intro'd Dem plan to replace sequester w/mix of cuts + revenues from Buffett Rule &amp; by ending big oil/ag subsidies http://t.co/TrMjm
If the automatic spending cuts hit on March 1, CBO est. 750K jobs will be lost this year. Americans deserve better - http://t.co/DTPnj9a0
GOP must stop scapegoating federal employees. They've already contributed more than their fair share to reducing the deficit.
Yesterday, for the 4th time, the GOP refused to allow a vote on the Dem plan (http://t.co/H6rcBWm8) to avert the #SequesterCrisis.

Pres. Obama made one thing perfectly clear tonight: an economy is grown from the middle out, not from the top down. #SOTU
Agree w/ POTUS re: need to invest in middle class. Goal of deficit reduction must be to grow econ, not European-style austerity. #SOTU

Just 8 legislative days left before the sequester hits and the do-nothing GOP is, well, doing nothing.
We should be focused like a laser on jobs and the economy - not playing political games.  http://t.co/Y532EESz
Thx to #FMLA, you can no longer lose your job should you need to take leave due to your or a family member's illness.
CBO budget outlook makes 1 thing clear- a balanced approach is a must if we want to stabilize&amp;grow the econ.  http://t.co/pNs5LUq3
Dems feel it's irresponsible to let the meat ax sequester cuts go fwd. R's wld rather play political games than prevent them.
GOP wasting another week w/gimmicks, slogans &amp; hashtags instead of being responsible &amp; dealing w/sequester. Time is running out.

#NRA's LaPierre took no Qs at his press conference b/c even he can't explain why anyone would ever need a high-capacity assault weapon.
Truly scary that the tea party GOP will fight to give millionaires $50k in bonus breaks even if it means driving the country off the cliff.
.@SpeakerBoehner's "Plan B" would give millionaires an avg tax cut of $50K. How's that for compromise? #MerryCliffmas
GOP sked'ing another vote on their unpoplar Reconciliation bill that
By voting on his Plan B &amp; Reconciliation cuts, Spkr Boehner is
.@SpeakerBoehner's "Plan B" = the latest example of the GOP walking away from negotiations. The "B" must stand for "Backing out."
Our prayers are w/all those who lost loved ones in this horrible tragedy. Together, we must find a way to end these senseless mass killings.

178 signatures on the petition to force a vote on extending middle class tax cuts. 218 needed. Keep track: http://t.co/khsFp4fl #my2k
Disappointed in Senate GOP for blocking ratification of #UNCRPD treaty. Rights for persons w/ disabilities should be a bipartisan value.
Tmrw Dems will petition to force vote on tax cuts for middle class, who shouldn't have to suffer b/c of a GOP-manufactured stalemate.
