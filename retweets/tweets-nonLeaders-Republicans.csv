The time is ripe for monetary reform. Getting monetary policy right is the foundation for economic growth. @CatoEvents
Stable prices and a sound dollar are what create the best foundation for job growth over the long term. @CatoEvents
SoundDollarAct is my vision for monetary policy to close the #GrowthGap &amp; ensure another American Century http://t.co/v5kHntCBFE @CatoEv
It?s time for a thorough review of U.S. monetary policy via the Centennial Monetary Commission Act http://t.co/V8D8iMOYFi @CateEvents
Creation of asset price bubbles, excess reserves on balance sheet are fuel for future inflation and incentive for financial repression.
Whatever its short-term benefits may be, quantitative easing poses great risks over time.  Let me outline three:  @CatoEvents
What are the benefits of quantitative easing?  Fed officials argue that QE is responsible for rising asset prices. @CatoEvents
While QE1 helped to boost stock prices, its effects on the real economy were quite small. @CatoEvents
Since 2008, monetary policy has gone into discretionary and interventionist hyper-drive... @CatoEvents
Monetary policy can only have a direct, positive effect on employment in short, temp spurts, at the cost of future econ growth &amp; employm
In response to ?stagflation,? Congress gave the Fed a dual mandate assigning equal weight to achieving stable prices and full employment.
During the 80s &amp; 90s, Chairmen Volcker &amp; Greenspan conducted monetary policy as if the Fed had a single mandate for price stability.
Fed failed its role as lender of last resort between 1929 &amp; 1933, leading to unnecessary bank failures, intensifying the Great Depressio
While the early Fed was successful in providing an elastic currency, eliminating the frequent, seasonal financial panics of the 19th century
Get monetary policy right, and our economy will have the wind at its back. @CatoEvents #GrowthGap
Get monetary policy wrong, our economy will face headwinds that good fiscal and regulatory policies may not be able to overcome @CatoEvents
We need to return to a predictable, rules-based monetary policy that maintains the purchasing power of the US dollar over time. @CatoEvents
We must overhaul the federal regulatory process to ensure necessary regulations are balanced and cost-effective @CatoEvents #GrowthGap
We must reduce federal spending &amp; debt as a percent of GDP, and we must pursue pro-growth tax reform. @CatoEvents #GrowthGap
If we want the United States to remain the world?s economic superpower, we must close this #GrowthGap. @CatoEvents
1% #GrowthGap is the difference between an $80T economy &amp; a $50T economy in 2062 &amp; is $97T less in federal taxes over 50 years. @Cat
A one-percentage point difference may not sound like much, but it is huge. Over the next 50 years... @CatoEvents #GrowthGap
The CBO recently reduced its estimate for future growth in potential real GDP from 3.2 percent to 2.2 percent. @CatoEvents #GrowthGap
Even more troubling is the possibility that the ability of economy to grow has been *permanently* diminished. @CatoEvents #GrowthGap
This recovery has produced $1.2T less in real GDP &amp; 4.1M fewer private sector jobs than an avg recovery during last 7 decades. @CatoEven
The Growth Gap is the difference in economic performance between this recovery and an average post-World War II recovery. @CatoEvents
Let me frame monetary policy in the broader context of the most critical economic challenge that we face?the Growth Gap. @CatoEvents
The work that @CatoInstitute does in pursuit of economic freedom and limited government is more important than ever. @CatoEvents
News stories breaking about the IRS targeting political enemies &amp; the DoJ wire-tapping the AP show something is clearly wrong. @CatoEven
Big government is a breeding ground for political abuse &amp; harmful social experimentation. Americans should not be Washington?s lab rabbi
Obama's policies are troubling; revelations over the past 5 days are awakening many to the dangers of unrestrained government. @CatoEvents

Taxes aren?t the forms you fill out. Americans pay taxes daily. Use your phone or filling your car? You?re paying taxes. It adds up. #TaxDay
Taxpayers had to wade through over 100 pages of instructions. In 1935, just two pages. This is too much red tape. #TaxDay
April 17 is #TaxFreedomDay. In 1900, this day was on January 22. This is too much! Americans cannot continue to shoulder such a burden.

Sequester was a polticial issue in Feb. all while immigration reform being worked on. This was like throwing a hand grenade in all of that.
Rep. Dent also just said this should have been handled better and was disappointed in how the releases were dealt with. Agreed Rep. Dent.
I agree with Rep. Dent and am worried these releases were an attempt to undermine the comprehensive immigration reform.
ICE Dir. Morton testifies at Homeland Security Approp. Subcommitte hearing 2,228 criminal aliens were released of a 3-week period in Feb.
ICE Dir. Morton just testified no level 1 illegal aliens were released in Texas; level one offenses such as agg. robbery, agg. sexual asslt.
ICE Director John Morton is testifying before the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee right now; answering Chairman Carter's Q's.

Pres. Obama "does not offer specific proposal" to avoid sequester.  I'm shocked. #cutspending

My take on today's Benghazi hearing: https://t.co/5ntvqKUG
Serious questions remain about #Benghazi. Ex: Why did Amb. Rice make statements contradicting known intelligence and analysis at the time?

Sec. Clinton regarding contradictory Benghazi explanations: "What difference does it make?" We'll, quite a difference, actually.

In Benghazi, multiple requests for increased security were denied and numerous warnings from Ambassador Stevens....

A decision to NOT read Miranda rights to the suspect was sound and in our national security interests.
Under the Law of War, suspect must be humanely treated, consistent w/ the Detainee Treatment Act, domestic law, and the Geneva Conventions.
As to any future trial, if this suspect is an American citizen, he is NOT subject to military commission trial. #Boston
An enemy combatant is entitled to a habeas hearing before a federal judge with appointment of a counsel. Usually, w/in 30 days of capture.
In a case like #Boston, it could take weeks to prepare the questions needed to be asked &amp; months before intelligence gathering is comple
The questioning of an enemy combatant for national security purposes has no limit on time or scope.

I hope the Obama Administration will seriously consider this option. #Boston
The goal is to gather intelligence and protect our nation which is under threat from radical Islam. #Boston
The Law of War allows us to hold individual in this scenario as potential enemy combatant w/o Miranda warnings or appointment of counsel.
The least of my worries is a criminal trial which will likely be held years from now. #Boston
We should be focused on preventing possible attacks over the coming hours and days.  #Boston
It is vital he be questioned for intelligence gathering purposes about possible future plots. #Boston
Now that the suspect is in custody, the last thing I want is for him to remain silent. #Boston
I appreciate the hard work and bravery  of our law enforcement and intelligence communities. #Boston
@washpost Boston bombing is 'Exhibit 'A' of why the homeland is the battlefield http://t.co/ed7t0jjzOu
The Obama Administration needs to be contemplating these issues and should not rush into a bad decision.
The last thing we may want to do is read Boston suspect Miranda Rights telling him to "remain silent."
If the #Boston suspect has ties to overseas terror organizations he could be treasure trove of  information.
If captured, I hope Administration will at least consider holding the Boston suspect as enemy combatant for intelligence gathering purposes.

In 2010, over 13,000 fugitives failed a background check yet less than 15 people were successfully prosecuted.
We already have major holes in the current NICS system. Instead of expanding a broken background check system, let?s fix it.
I will oppose the Toomey-Manchin background check amendment. The proposal, while well-intentioned, is not a solution to illegal gun violence
I welcome a debate on gun control. The American people deserve to see where their elected representatives stand on the Second Amendment.
The gun control legislation can still be filibustered after today in the United States Senate.
My legislation, backed by the NRA, would make a real difference in keeping guns out of the wrong hands.
I have my own legislation, supported by the NRA, which I want to bring forward in the Senate.
Some politicians? dream scenario is 1 where they don?t have to vote For / Against but can tell each side they were with them all along.
Nothing the Democrats are proposing would have prevented the Sandy Hook massacre.We need Senators on record, do you support these proposals?

Hatch: "Ruling reaffirms that the Constitution is above political party or agenda, despite what the Obama Admin seems to think." #NLRB
Hatch: "My proposals ... will help ensure that future generations have a viable and sustainable safety net in place."
Hatch: These 5 specific entitlement reform porposals are reasonable, rational ideas that have all enjoyed bipartisan support over the years.
Hatch: "Number Five ? We need to strengthen Medicaid for patients and states through realistic reforms."
Hatch: "Number Four ? We need to increase quality and lower costs in Medicare by introducing competitive bidding into the program."
Hatch: "Number Three ? We need to simplify Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing while protecting seniors from catastrophic health costs."
Hatch: "Number Two?Modernize Medigap by limiting supplemental Medicare plans from covering initial out-of-pocket expenses for beneficiaries"
Hatch: "Number One - We need to adjust the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67."
Sen. Hatch laying out five specific proposals to rein in entitlement spending and put our nation on a better fiscal course...
Hatch: "So btw Medicare &amp; Medicaid, we have two programs that threaten to swallow up, not only the federal gvmt, but state gvmts as well
Hatch: "In the next ten years, federal Medicaid spending as a share of the U.S. economy is set to grow by 37 percent."

Sen
Hatch: Most Republicans open to increased revenues, but only if revenue increases are coupled with entitlement spending reform.
President?s insistence on $1.6 tril tax hike that isn't supported by the American ppl nor even elected Dems isn?t about deficit reduction.
With a deficit of over $1 trillion, the President is willing to send us over the cliff for as little as $23 billion in additional revenue.
Republicans have expressed willingness to work w/ the President to raise revenue without raising tax rates, but the Pres refuses to budge.
Why would Democrats jeopardize the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of American workers and the economic security of their families?
But it seems increasingly clear that the President and Democrats in Congress are content to go over the cliff, regardless of the outcome.
Need to have a serious convo about spending, but so far the President, @TheDemocrats &amp; liberal interest groups have refused to engage.
President?s commitment to balanced approach of new tax revenue &amp; spending reforms has morphed into new tax revenue and increased spendin

Marriage is society?s best guarantee of a limited government that stays out of family life. #DOMA

Governments recognizes marriage because it is an institution that benefits society in a way no other relationship does. #DOMA

It is wrong for #SCOTUS to silence democratic debate and redefine marriage by judicial fiat.
41 states affirm that marriage is between a man and a woman. Are we going to tell them their voices don?t count?
Redefining marriage would deny as a matter of policy the ideal that a child needs a mom and a dad. #DOMA
Decades of social science show that children do better when raised by a mom and dad. Obama agrees. #DOMA

BTW only $44Bil of the $85Bil in cuts happen this budget year.  Real cut this year is just 1.2%
Perspective $85bil sequester is 2.3% reduction of the $3.46T spending projection.  Don't call it a budget- Senate hasn't passed one in 4yrs
The average price of a gallon of regular gasoline has jumped 45 cents in the past 33 days- time for a better energy policy.
In 2011 fed gov made est $115 billion in improper payments- where people received bens or payment that not entitled to or no docs #CutWaste
The EPA has given more than $100 million in grants to foreign countries over the last ten years #CutThatWaste
The federal government spent?$51.6 million?last year promoting ObamaCare &amp; PR firms- #CutThatWaste
You can see @RepLaMalfa running the US house floor on @cspan.  He's been presiding over general speeches
More gun laws won't solve the problem. They will only restrict freedom.  Laws only effect those that follow them- aka not criminals
Glad to hear we will prevent Iran from getting Nukes. Something we should all agree on
@MegRaeB will work together on many things- much of speech no- more taxes and regs- no. Fixing core problems yes. Increase accountability
How about we get Govt out of the way so real jobs grow. More Govt regs will destroy the american dream. P2 has already written over 5k pages
HSR is a boondoggle that will hurt CA and few will ride.  How about we use money to fix out existing infrastructure like hwy 99 and I-5
Fix it first was supposed to be stimulus- this looks like break it and fix it second #SOTU
How has adding 9 million to long term unemployment "added jobs". #SOTU
$4 gas is not cheaper Mr. President.  California pays more for power than we ever have.  New carbon taxes won't help CA. #NoNewTaxes
Passing PLAN Act today- #Budget and #Debt are priority. House working to Balance budget and pay down debt. Sen + Prez need to get serious
Everyone has to come to the table with a plan to balance the budget. The President &amp; the Senate need to join the House- Produce a Plan

Unemployment and GDP numbers show the real focus should be on economy and jobs. Govt needs to get out of the way
It?s no surprise that economy shrank when Washington spent entire month of December arguing over how much more to take from us.
Glad to see the Senate Pass #nobudgetnopay Maybe they can pass a budget now, something they haven't done in 4 yrs.
The President has disbanded his jobs Council after not meeting with them for a year. It's time to focus on the Economy not ignore it.
@mwestonmercury thanks Mary!
To fix budget/ debt need to reduce spending AND grow economy- that means more Jobs + better opportunity for all.
Carbon tax is a sure way to hurt the economy and move clean industry from usa to foreign countries where less restrictions. #nocarbontax

@CharlieBeyer RAISING tax rates drives growth?  Taxing something = less of something (smoking, carbon). Same for wealth #askrsc #sctweets
@CharlieBeyer And Obama has no plan for growth.   0.3% increase in GDP over 10 years raises more $ than his tax hikes #askrsc #sctweets
@CharlieBeyer The current tax rates generated record revenues in mid 2000s.  Growth is what drives revs, not tax rates. #askrsc #sctweets

Obama mentioned...Debt: 2 times, Budget: 4 times, Obamacare: 1 time Spending: 3 times, Sequester: 1 time, Unemployment: 0 times #SOTU
In the 59 minutes President Obama spoke, the national debt went up $123.5 million and the US government spent $404 million. #SOTU
I oppose a mandatory increase in the minimum wage.  This hike would result in lost jobs and hurt the very people it is intended to help.
History shows that gun bans keep guns away from law abiding citizens, not criminals.
Heartbroken by the tragedy in Newtown but gun bans are not the answer. Focus needs to be on mental health, school security.
Tax increases are not the answer.  It is time to get serious about spending.
House Republicans have twice passed sequestration alternatives.  We should replace indiscriminate cuts with targeted spending reductions.

@GiljGilj we have to cut spending.If president doesn't like #Sequester, he should show what cuts he would make.All he talks about is taxes.
The #Sequester ...was discussed,?  Jay Carney said. ... ?and as has been reported, it was an idea that the White House put forward.?
@kjanes741 republicans passed two bills to address #Sequester. Senate 0. President just wants to raise taxes and spend and borrow more.
@BlueDuPage nope this was presidents idea. WH confirmed it.
@TurnerDad this is the presidents idea and i didn't vote for it.
You are about to see how incompetent the Obama administration is when the #Sequester takes place. Surely they can run things with a 5% cut.
Thanks for the #FollowFriday #FF: @FinancialCmte @RepGarrett @RepShelley @RepJohnCampbell @PatrickMcHenry

With an increasing amt of debt, millions of Americans out of work, POTUS wants $2.6 TRILLION in new taxes on the American people.
NEW TAX HIKES: Pres health care law = $1 trillion, Pres budget = $1.1 trillion, January 2013 = $600billion. #SpendingIsTheProblem
January 2013 - President Obama got his $600 billion in new tax hikes on the American people. #ObamaTaxHike
On this National Day of Prayer -- encouraged by: 2 Chronicles 7:14
President Obama?s health care law = $1 trillion in new tax hikes. #ObamaTaxHike
President Obama?s Budget = $1.1 trillion in new tax hikes. #ObamaTaxHike
Americans do not need another #ObamaTaxHike. We need fundamental, fair, pro-growth tax reform. House GOP are committed to this.

FACT: POTUS? budget adds 2 new tax increases to IRA &amp; 401(k) savers. A total tax increase of $14billion. #ObamaTaxHike
FACT: The President?s budget would double the tobacco tax ? a total tax increase of $78billion. #ObamaTaxHike
FACT: The President?s budget would raise the death tax from 40% to 45% - a total tax increase of $79billion. #ObamaTaxHike
POTUS? health care law will hurt #smallbiz &amp; their employees w/ higher costs, fewer choices. #FullRepeal
POTUS choosing to ignore the higher premiums; loss of current coverage plans; fewer full-time jobs; his tax on medical innovation.
POTUS says those already insured don?t need to worry about rest of health care law?s implementation.

The priorities of the American people ? stronger economy &amp; a govt that lives within its means ? are not reflected in POTUS? budget.
The American people continue to ask that we tackle the nation?s fiscal &amp; economic challenges - POTUS chooses not to listen.
2 months late &amp; still POTUS settles on a plan that saddles the public w/ higher taxes, more debt &amp; less economic opportunity.
POTUS calls his budget ?fiscally responsible.? Does $964 billion in NEW spending &amp; $8.2 trillion in NEW debt sound responsible to you?

Thanks to Sen. McConnell for coming down to support the filibuster and for helping save the floor for me tonight.
My fellow Kentucky Senator, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, has joined me on the floor to filibuster the nomination of John Brennan.
Sen. Cruz reading Tweets from all of you meant a lot to me. Protecting the Constitution is everyone's fight.
Are we going to use the standard that the 5th Amendment applies when we think it applies, but doesn't apply when we don't think it applies?
The President is advocating a drone strike program in America. All we have to compare it with is the drone strike program overseas.
They shouldn't just drop a hellfire missile on your caf? experience.
I don't know how to halfway believe you should declare war. I don't know how to halfway believe in the Fifth Amendment.
It's not enough to say 'I don't intend to break the Constitution.' You either believe in the Constitution or you don't.
I just can't imagine the President can't answer these questions, and its not enough to say 'I have no intention to do so.'
Even under George W. Bush, no one maintained that you could kill Americans at home.
If you have no bounds, you have an unlimited, imperial presidency.
Does the President have the power to decide when the Bill of Rights applies?
The government has defined 'terrorist' in this country to include things that might not include terrorists.
When your government won't tell you they don't have the power to do something, they're telling you they do have that power.
There have been those who say "you don't get a lawyer, shut up!" That's what we're moving towards.
I'm not a great fan of Jane Fonda. But I'm not so interested in putting her on a drone kill list either.
The American people deserve a clear statement from the President concerning limits of executive power.
Since we began this today I've had no communication from the White House or Attorney General.
Our right, as an American, to be tried in a court by our peers, should not be given up on.
One of the things we have to ask: What kind of standard will there be? If we're going to kill Americans in America, what kind of standard?
This conversation is about whether or not, in America, some rights are so special that we cannot give up.
We should try people for treason. It's one of the four crimes given to the federal courts in the Constitution.
It's harder to defeat an enemy if the entire world is a battlefield.
Here's that Eugene Robinson column: Judicial review needed for drone hits of citizens - San Antonio Express-News http://t.co/ZyR3sq7IHd
Bush started this, Obama is expanding this. The irony is that Obama ran as the anti-Bush candidate.
If you give up your rights now, don't expect to get them back.
I don't know how you can argue that we have exemptions to the Bill of Rights, whenever you want to.
We've always allowed a great deal of dissent in our country.
The President has shown no regard for the individual rights of Americans.
Do we not get the opportunity to explain ourselves in a court of law before we get a hellfire missile dropped on our heads?
It's not partisan against partisan; it's bipartisan working for the power of the checks &amp; balances to try to ensure a leveling #filibliz
Brennan's answer to me shouldn't have been "no," it should have been, "NEVER. Never will it come to that in America" http://t.co/rbFgPvxPPB
No President has the right to say that he is judge, jury, and executioner. #filiblizzard http://t.co/rbFgPvxPPB
As we allow more and more power to gravitate to the President, we run the risk of living under an imperial presidency. #filiblizzard
What are we fighting for if we're not going to protect our rights at home? #filiblizzard http://t.co/rbFgPvxPPB
I will not sit quietly and let President Obama shred the Constitution. #filiblizzard
It worries me that they refuse to answer my questions, because by refusing to answer, I believe that they believe they have unlimited power.
What happened to candidate Obama who wanted to protect your right to privacy? He now doesn't care about your right to judicial proceeding.
Why isn't there more moral outrage? Why isn't every Senator coming down to say let's go ahead and hold this nomination?
Why don't we advise the pres. that he should come forward &amp; say he will not condone nor believe he has the authority to kill noncombatan
